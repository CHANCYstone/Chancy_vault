1.AI and Nuclear: A perfect intersection of danger and potential?
This paper explores the relationship between AI and NUC in China, additionally highlighting nuclear energy’s positive effects on AI. Firstly, our analysis indicated a significant mutual influence between AI and NUC through a full-sample Granger causality analysis. Further analysis through a parameter stability assessment indicated the fluctuating nature of the AI-NUC relationship. Therefore, we adopted a sub-sample rolling window causality method to optimize the accuracy of our findings, which indeed corroborated the existence of reciprocal causality. AI’s impact on NUC was found to be mixed, with proponents suggesting AI could accelerate advancements in nuclear power technology. In contrast, critics pointed to the reduced electricity costs in 2017 to challenge this view. Conversely, NUC’s positive effect on AI highlights nuclear power’s vital role in cultivating AI’s sustainable progress. Contrary to prevalent assertions in the literature, our study of the timevarying phase relationship between AI and NUC suggests that AI does not truly serve as an incentive for nuclear energy technological advancements. Exploring the complex empirical findings, we understand that the integration of AI in monitoring nuclear energy systems can significantly mitigate accident risks, thus offering humanity a more dependable energy resource. Crucially, leveraging AI in nuclear power not only underpins technical strategies and options for sustainable growth but also cultivates the integration of nuclear power with alternative clean energy sources. Through sophisticated energy management systems, AI paves the pathways for integration of various energy types, steering the global energy framework towards more eco-friendly and carbon-efficient solutions. This shift is critical for redefining the energy structure to prioritize cleanliness and reduced carbon footprints. In addition, the mutual benefits between nuclear power and AI indicate that nuclear energy, as a pristine source of power, stands to significantly bolster energy supply for future AI trainings while reducing carbon emissions. Such an advantage is key in expeditingthe shift in energy paradigms and nurturing economic progress aligned with low-carbon objectives. The convergence between nuclear power and AI is a beacon for the energy sector’s move to automation, heralding an era of intelligent energy management systems that surpass the capabilities of traditional systems dependent on fossil fuels.

2.The role of AI capabilities in environmental management: Evidence from USA firms
In this paper, we examine the impact of AI capabilities on greenwashing. We find robust results that AI capabilities exert a significant negative causal effect on greenwashing practices. The effects are stronger when firms face higher regulatory climate risk, managers are republicanleaning, shareholders have more rights, and firms have higher product market pricing power, firms are more involved in BRI initiatives, and CEOs have higher pay-performance sensitivity. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we find that AI capabilities help firms transition into green operations through engaging in green innovation and clean innovation. Finally, we find that AI capabilities are associated with lower carbon emissions. Overall, our results shed light on the real effect of AI related technologies in the energy industry. Future research could focus on several areas to deepen our understanding of how AI capabilities affect corporate greenwashing. Studies may explore the specific ways AI influences firms’ environmental disclosures, considering factors like AI system sophistication and industry context. Longitudinal analyses could track how AI adoption impacts firms’ greenwashing behavior over time. Additionally, research could investigate how regulatory frameworks and industry standards shape AI’s effectiveness in preventing greenwashing. Comparative studies across regions might reveal contextual influences on the AI-greenwashing relationship. Interdisciplinary collaborations could develop advanced tools for detecting and preventing greenwashing by integrating insights from AI, environmental science, economics, and management. Overall, future research holds promise in uncovering AI’s potential to promote transparency, accountability, and sustainability in corporate practices, thereby reducing greenwashing.

3.Impact of artificial intelligence on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability: Evidence from 61 countries

This study matches data from global industrial robotics, UN Comtrade, and World Development Indicators databases to obtain country product-level panel data from 2000 to 2019. We apply the trade network analysis method to calculate the supply chain vulnerability of renewable energy products in 61 countries. The effects and mechanisms of AI applications on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability are also empirically tested. To replace the explanatory variables, we employ the progressive DID model to eliminate the influence of other interference factors, overcome the robustness of the endogenous verification core conclusions, and further test the heterogeneity of national income, product vulnerability, digital infrastructure popularity, and renewable energy industry development stage. Finally, we construct an inverse distance spatial weight matrix and use the SDM to explore the special spillover effects of AI. The resultsdemonstrate that AI couldsignificantly alleviate renewable energy supply chain vulnerability, a core conclusion that remains following robustness tests such as replacing explanatory variables, stripping the net impact effect of AI, and addressing reverse causality endogeneity. The mechanism test shows that AI alleviates vulnerability to the renewable energy supply chain through technological innovation, governance system optimization, and promotion of trade network status. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that AI can have an effective role as a supply chain ‘stabilizer’ in middle-income countries, for high-vulnerability products, in countries with prevalent digital infrastructure, and in those in the initial stages of the renewable energy industry. Finally, the results of decomposing the AI spatial spillover effects show that AI can directly alleviate renewable energy supply chain vulnerability in host and neighboring countries. This study proposed the following suggestions based on the above theoretical analysis and empirical results. First, the technological innovation of AI should be fully leveraged to promote the integration and development of supply and innovation chains to enhance independent and controllable supply chain capabilities. Specifically, countries can encourage enterprises and scientific research institutions to conduct industry–university–research collaboration, apply AI to identify key green core technology and address product bottlenecks, effectively empower the sustainability and adaptability of renewable energy supply chains and form more innovative, higher value-added, autonomous and controllable supply chains. Countries should also prioritize promoting the deep application of AI across all supply chains, establish AI control systems in production processes to improve supply chain efficiency, employ AI automation systems in supply chain management to improve supply chain collaboration and promote AI for low-income countries, low-vulnerability products, countries with low popularity of digital infrastructure and those with renewable energy industries in mature stages of renewable energy supply chain vulnerability mitigation. In addition, all nations should recognize and leverage the spatial spillover effects of AI and fully strengthen the cooperation and exchange ofneighboring countries in core technology fields of renewable energy, cross-regional and cross-country flow, and accumulation of technological elements to promote energy transformation, ensure energy security and establish stable, safe, resilient and sustainable global renewable energy supply chains. Finally, Countries should actively implement supportive regulations and policies related to renewable energy, guide and encourage various domestic economic entities to participate in developing and using renewable energy and promote continuous cost reduction in the renewable energy industry, continuous efficiency improvement, and continuous enhancement of competitiveness to realise the efficiency and safety of renewable energy supply chains.

4.AI adoption rate and corporate green innovation efficiency: Evidence from Chinese energy companies
The advent of AI has recently revolutionized the operational planning and production modes of publicly listed companies. This study focuses on 279 energy companies listed on China ’s A-share markets, using data from 2010 to 2020. We use textualanalysis methods from the field of machine learning to construct an indicator of the AI adoption rate, which provides an objective and realistic depiction of the extent to which energy companies have embraced AI technology. We then apply an array of econometric models, including basic regression, generalized bifurcation, robustness testing, mechanism analysis, and heterogeneity analysis, to empirically examine the influence of the AI adoptionrate on green innovation in energy companies. Based on our findings, we can draw conclusions and offer recommendations for both energy companies and policymakers. Emphasizing AI technology adoption within energy companies holds the promise of significantly bolstering green innovation output. This positive effect can be further amplified when energy companies increase their efforts toward ESG initiatives. However, a vigilant approach is essential among executives because the potentially deleterious moderating effects of short-termism on both AI technology and GIE warrant careful consideration. Our conclusions are as follows. First, the baseline regression results indicate that AI adoption can significantly enhance energy companies’ GIE. Second, the endogeneity test reveals that the current period of AI adoption positively affects corporate green innovation during subsequent periods. Thus, AI technology not only boosts the current period’s green innovation knowledge output but also positively affects future green goal setting and implementation, providing valuable insights for long-term planning within energy companies. Third, our mechanism analysis reveals that a company ’s ESG performance can positively moderate the effects of AI adoption on corporate GIE. Further analysis from the perspective of internal executives indicates that executives who focus on short-term benefits negatively moderate the effect of AI adoption on corporate GIE, thereby diminishing its positive effects. Fourth, according to the heterogeneity test, the effect of AI adoption on corporate GIE is significantly positively correlated with firms in which the CEO also holds the chairperson position, that are state-owned, and that do not hold bank shares. Fifth, this study utilizes the environmental protection mandate issued by President Xi in 2017 as a temporal reference point and performs an empirical analysis using the generalized difference-in-difference model. The results indicate that even post-2017, AI adoption has continued to exert a significant positive influence on energy companies’ GIE. Based on the above findings, the main conclusions have several valuable implications for energy companies. First, in this era of heightened environmental consciousness, energy companies can stra tegically adopt AI technology to stimulate green innovation, thereby enhancing their environmental performance. Second, based on the mechanism analysis of ESG, we propose that energy companies should not only incorporate AI technology into their green innovation activities but also augment their investment in ESG activities to achieve their goals for sustainable development. Third, based on the findings of the heterogeneity test, energy companies should enhance the effectiveness of AI technology in relation to corporate green innovation and sustainable development by allowing the CEO to also hold the board chairperson position, appropriately nationalizing the company’s capital, and reducing the company’s bank shareholding when feasible. This study has several important implications for executives. First, by investing more in AI technology, energy companies can increase their green patent output. Second, the mechanism analysis of executive myopia suggests that corporate executives should shift their focus away from immediate gains and toward long-term development. Although the benefits of adopting AI technology may not be immediately apparent, a lagged analysis of the robustness check indicates that introducing AI technology could stimulate green innovation output in the future.


4.The rising role of artificial intelligence in renewable energy development in China
This exploration investigates the transmission mechanism between the AI marketand RE developmentand further answers whether AI is an energy transition facilitator or a disputer. We perform the wavelet analysis methods to probe the connection between AI and RE. This methodology empowers us to identify the bilateral relationships and time-varying dynamics between AI and RE. The positive impacts observed from AI to RE indicate that elevated levels of AI will likely prompt the energy transition process, suggesting that AI is a facilitatorof energy transition in China. Conversely, lower levels of AI mayhinder the attainment of this objective. In addition, a positive impact is detected only after late 2018, revealing that in the earlystages of AI technological development, the guiding role of AI in RE development is minimal. These findings support the hypotheses derived from the TEP, suggesting that the dynamics of AI and RE are consistent with the interactive patterns observed in technological revolutions and emerging industries within the TEP framework. The underlying reason for AI’s driving role may be associated with three aspects. First, AI technology addresses the technical challenges related to RE, concurrently reducing its relative costs. Second, through a series of incremental advancements after 2018, a coupling effect between the AI and RE industries emerged after late 2018. Third, investors who understand the contributions of AI and hold optimistic expectations for the AI industry are more likely to adopt a positive attitude toward RE development, thus increasing the share of RE in theirportfolio. By investigating the dynamic interrelation between AI and RE, it can be inferred that AI started to lead RE by the end of 2018. However, AI plays a role only occasionally as an energy transition facilitator, which is determined by various factors.

5.Can artificial intelligence help accelerate the transition to renewable energy?

This study examines whether AI always improves the energy transition using a wavelet-based QQ approach in China. We find that the results are heterogenous across various stages. AI has a negative impact on REG and REI in the short and medium terms. This finding confirms the existence of AI’s “inhibiting effect” on the proportion of RE in total energy. The primary reason is that AI has been applied to the non-RE sector to improve efficiency, whereas its applications in the RE sector is limited due to its complexity and high cost. As a result, the non-RE sector may benefit more from AI than the RE sector in the short and medium terms. However, the upper quantiles of AI will promote REG and REI in the long term, with a more significant impact at the higher REG quantiles, consistent with AI’s “promoting effect.” AI has great potential in RE generation and demand-side forecasting and manage ment, grid operations and optimization, and material discovery and innovation. As the current technical difficulties associated with RE are resolved by AI developments, the share of RE in total energy will increase in the long term.

6.How does artificial intelligence affect pollutant emissions by improving energy efficiency and developing green technology

nvironmental protection and energy efficiency are urgent concerns and must be specifically addressed in China and across the world. The emergence of AI provides an opportunity to tackle these challenges. As one of the most important applications of AI technology, industrial robots are increasingly being integrated into production and are a crucial feature of high-quality economic development. To analyze the impact of industrial robot application on pollution emissions intensity, this study uses panel data of the provinces in China from 2010 to 2019 to explore the mechanisms of energy efficiency and pollution reduction technologies considering the influence of regional and economic belt heterogeneity and mechanism differences. The following conclusions are drawn. ➢ Regardless of the control variables, industrial robot adoption significantly reduces pollution emissions intensity in many provinces of China. This conclusion remains valid following a series of robustness tests. ➢ Examination of the mechanism effects reveals that industrial robot adoption reduces pollution emissions intensity by improving energy efficiency and enhancing pollution reduction technologies. The application of industrial robots leads to technological advancements in production, which improves energy efficiency and reduces pollution emissions. It can also improve enterprise productivity, expand output scale, promote investment in pollution reduction technology, enhance pollution reduction technology, and ultimately lower pollution emissions. ➢ The regional heterogeneity analysis shows that the application of industrial robots significantly reduces pollution emissions intensity in eastern and western regions, while the change in pollution emissions intensity in provinces located in the central region is not sig nificant after the introduction of industrial robots. ➢ The economic belt heterogeneity analysis reveals that in regions belonging to major strategic economic belts in China, the introduction of industrial robots does not lead to reducedpollution emissions intensity. While in noneconomic belt regions, industrial robot adoption effectively reduces pollution emissions intensity. ➢ Our mechanism difference analysis indicates that for the eastern region, the application of industrial robots primarily promotes the effect of pollution reduction, rather than enhancing energy efficiency. In contrast, for the western region, the reduction in pollution emissions intensity may be attributed to the presence of both mechanisms. For noneconomic belt regions, the application of industrial robots significantly improves energy efficiency and pollution reduction technologies. Based on data availability, this study uses provincial panel data to explore the impact of robot adoption on pollution emissions intensity. Manufacturing enterprises could be one of the important participants in improving AI, whereas enterprises in heavy pollution industries are the main pollution dischargers. In further research, we will attempt to collect data for manufacturing industry enterprises and comprehen sively investigate the sources of pollution emissions and AI beneficiaries. At the same time, deeper research insights should be provided that analyze the possible competitive and cooperative relationships between manufacturing enterprises as the intelligentization process will be affected by such relationships. Exploration of the competitive or cooperative relationships to reduce pollution emissions could be a viable direction for future research.


# How much electricity does AI consume?

## It’s not easy to calculate the watts and joules that go into a single Balenciaga pope. But we’re not completely in the dark about the true energy cost of AI.

It’s common knowledge that machine learning consumes a _lot_ of energy. All those AI models powering email summaries, [regicidal chatbots](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67012224), and videos of Homer Simpson singing nu-metal are racking up a hefty server bill measured in megawatts per hour. But no one, it seems — not even the companies behind the tech — can say exactly what the cost is. 
>  到底用了多少能？我们说他用能多用能多，但是到底用多少呢？

**Estimates do exist, but experts say those figures are partial and contingent, offering only a glimpse of AI’s total energy usage**. This is because machine learning models are incredibly variable, able to be configured in ways that dramatically alter their power consumption. Moreover, the organizations best placed to produce a bill — companies like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI — **simply aren’t sharing the relevant information.** (Judy Priest, CTO for cloud operations and innovations at Microsoft said in an e-mail that the company is currently “**investing in developing methodologies to quantify the energy use and carbon impact of AI while working on ways to make large systems more efficient, in both training and application.**” OpenAI and Meta did not respond to requests for comment.)

**One important factor we can identify is the difference between training a model for the first time and deploying it to users**. Training, in particular, is extremely energy intensive, consuming much more electricity than traditional data center activities. **Training a large language model like GPT-3, for example, is [estimated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02001.pdf) to use just under 1,300 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity; about as much power as [consumed annually](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3) by 130 US homes**. To put that in context, **streaming an hour of Netflix requires around [0.8 kWh](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines) (0.0008 MWh) of electricity. That means you’d have to watch 1,625,000 hours to consume the same amount of power it takes to train GPT-3**.

But it’s difficult to say how a figure like this applies to current state-of-the-art systems. The energy consumption could be bigger, because AI models have been steadily trending upward in size for years and bigger models require more energy. On the other hand, companies might be using some of the [proven methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10350.pdf) to make these systems more energy efficient — which would dampen the upward trend of energy costs.

The challenge of making up-to-date estimates, says Sasha Luccioni, a researcher at French-American AI firm Hugging Face, is that **companies have become more secretive as AI has become profitable.** Go back just a few years and firms like OpenAI would publish details of their training regimes — what hardware and for how long. But the same information simply doesn’t exist for the latest models, like ChatGPT and GPT-4, says Luccioni.

“With ChatGPT we don’t know how big it is, we don’t know how many parameters the underlying model has, we don’t know where it’s running … It could be three raccoons in a trench coat because you just don’t know what’s under the hood.”

“It could be three raccoons in a trench coat because you just don’t know what’s under the hood.”

**Luccioni, who’s authored several papers examining AI energy usage, suggests this secrecy is partly due to competition between companies but is also an attempt to divert criticism.** Energy use statistics for AI — especially its most frivolous use cases — naturally invite comparisons to the **wastefulness of cryptocurrency.** “There’s a growing awareness that all this doesn’t come for free,” she says.

Training a model is only part of the picture. After a system is created, it’s rolled out to consumers who use it to generate output, a process known as “inference.” Last December, Luccioni and colleagues from Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University [published a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf) (currently awaiting peer review) that contained the first estimates of inference energy usage of various AI models. 
>  估计了AI models的能源强度

Luccioni and her colleagues ran tests on 88 different models spanning a range of use cases, from answering questions to identifying objects and generating images. In each case, they ran the task 1,000 times and estimated the energy cost. Most tasks they tested use a small amount of energy, like 0.002 kWh to classify written samples and 0.047 kWh to generate text. If we use our hour of Netflix streaming as a comparison, these are equivalent to the energy consumed watching nine seconds or 3.5 minutes, respectively. (Remember: that’s the cost to perform each task 1,000 times.) The figures were notably larger for image-generation models, which used on average 2.907 kWh per 1,000 inferences. As the paper notes, the [average smartphone](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references#smartphones) uses 0.012 kWh to charge — so generating one image using AI can use almost as much energy as charging your smartphone.
>  一个模型弄好后，用户端调取模型所使用的电是极少的


The emphasis, though, is on “can,” as these figures do not necessarily generalize across all use cases. Luccioni and her colleagues tested ten different systems, from small models producing tiny 64 x 64 pixel pictures to larger ones generating 4K images, and this resulted in a huge spread of values. The researchers also standardized the hardware used in order to better compare different AI models. This doesn’t necessarily reflect real-world deployment, where software and hardware are often optimized for energy efficiency. 

“Definitely this is not representative of everyone’s use case, but now at least we have some numbers,” says Luccioni. “I wanted to put a flag in the ground, saying ‘Let’s start from here.’”

“The generative AI revolution comes with a planetary cost that is completely unknown to us.”

The study provides useful relative data, then, though not absolute figures. It shows, for example, that AI models require more power to generate output than they do when classifying input. It also shows that anything involving imagery is more energy intensive than text. Luccioni says that although the contingent nature of this data can be frustrating, this tells a story in itself. “The generative AI revolution comes with a planetary cost that is completely unknown to us and the spread for me is particularly indicative,” she says. “The tl;dr is we just don’t know.” 

So trying to nail down the energy cost of generating a single **Balenciaga pope** is tricky because of the morass of variables. But if we want to better understand the planetary cost, there are other tacks to take. What if, instead of focusing on model inference, we zoom out?

This is the approach of Alex de Vries, a PhD candidate at VU Amsterdam who cut his teeth calculating the energy expenditure of Bitcoin for his blog _Digiconomist_, and who has used Nvidia GPUs — the gold standard of AI hardware — to estimate the sector’s global energy usage. As de Vries explains in commentary [published in _Joule_](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00365-3) last year, Nvidia accounts for roughly 95 percent of sales in the AI market. The company also releases energy specs for its hardware and sales projections. 

By combining this data, de Vries calculates that **by 2027 the AI sector could consume between 85 to 134 terawatt hours each year.** That’s about the same as the annual energy demand of de Vries’ home country, the Netherlands.
> tw = 1,000gw
> pw = 1,000 tw



“You’re talking about **AI electricity consumption potentially being half a percent of global electricity consumption by 2027**,” de Vries tells _The Verge_. “I think that’s a pretty significant number.”

A recent report by the International Energy Agency offered [similar estimates](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea), suggesting that electricity usage by data centers will increase significantly in the near future thanks to the demands of AI and cryptocurrency. The agency says **current data center energy usage stands at around 460 terawatt hours in 2022 and could increase to between 620 and 1,050 TWh in 2026 — equivalent to the energy demands of Sweden or Germany, respectively**. 

But de Vries says putting these figures in context is important. He notes that between 2010 and 2018, data center energy usage has been fairly stable, accounting for around 1 to 2 percent of global consumption. (And when we say “data centers” here we mean everything that makes up “the internet”: from the internal servers of corporations to all the apps you can’t use offline on your smartphone.) Demand certainly went up over this period, says de Vries, but the hardware got more efficient, thus offsetting the increase. 

His fear is that things might be different for AI precisely because of the trend for companies to simply throw bigger models and more data at any task. “That is a really deadly dynamic for efficiency,” says de Vries. “Because it creates a natural incentive for people to just keep adding more computational resources, and as soon as models or hardware becomes more efficient, people will make those models even bigger than before.” 

The question of whether efficiency gains will offset rising demand and usage is impossible to answer. Like Luccioni, de Vries bemoans the lack of available data but says the world can’t just ignore the situation. “It’s been a bit of a hack to work out which direction this is going and it’s certainly not a perfect number,” he says. “But it’s enough foundation to give a bit of a warning.”

Some companies involved in AI claim the technology itself could help with these problems. Priest, speaking for Microsoft, said AI “will be a powerful tool for advancing sustainability solutions,” and emphasized that Microsoft was working to reach “sustainability goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030.”

But the goals of one company can never encompass the full industry-wide demand. Other approaches may be needed.

Luccioni says that she’d like to see companies introduce energy star ratings for AI models, allowing consumers to compare energy efficiency the same way they might for appliances. For de Vries, our approach should be more fundamental: do we even need to use AI for particular tasks at all? “Because considering all the limitations AI has, it’s probably not going to be the right solution in a lot of places, and we’re going to be wasting a lot of time and resources figuring that out the hard way,” he says.

近年人工智慧 (AI) 技術以超出專家預期的速度持續突破與應用， AI 儼然成為現世代的顯學，其應用範疇亦一直延伸到各種領域，但如同水一樣，能載舟也能覆舟， AI 技術的廣泛應用也讓大家開始關注，在享受 AI 帶來便利的同時，所伴隨而至的風險隱憂。本文將淺談 AI 在能源領域應用的利基，以及伴隨而來的風險和挑戰。

**一、AI 在能源領域的應用利基**

根據 [Precedence Research](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/) 研究機構的研究報告，指出在2021 年的可再生能源市場規模中， AI 的應用已達 82.4 億美元，預計到 2030 年，將超過 758.2 億美元左右，2021 年至 2030 年的複合年增長率為 27.9%，足以顯見在現今面臨氣候變遷的威脅下，全球致力於追求可再生更乾淨能源，將 AI 技術與能源發展相結合，正被期待創造出更多的能源轉型機會，而將 AI 技術應用於能源領域的優勢與效益，簡述如下：

1. 可再生能源發電和需求預測：可再生能源受日照與風力等氣候因素影響甚大，利用 AI 技術可以從巨量的歷史數據幫助監測和預測天氣，協助電廠選址、設計，且在電廠運行時，透過快速的回饋來調整太陽能和風力發電廠的發電參數，提高整體電廠的發電效率，同時從再生能源發電量的高低峰與間歇性，與其他發電能源或儲能系統做最適化調配，藉以提升整體發電系統的效率和可靠性。而一些精準的預測資料更有助於能源政策或淨零減排作為更加完善，更有利於促進永續能源的發展。
2. 傳統能源生產與開發：可利用 AI 改善油氣開採技術，提高產量和降低成本，例如使用人工智慧分析地震數據，來尋找油源和改善開採過程。此外， AI 可以將過去的生產歷史數據加以分析，幫助生產製程的管理，降低生產成本。
3. 電網運維與最適化：當發電結構多元化後，不同發電形式的電力併網，對電網輸配電穩定帶來很大的挑戰，尤其可再生能源受氣候影響的間歇性，一個 AI 化的電網更顯得重要，如[美國能源部](https://www.energy.gov/)更將「智慧化電網」作為國家政策目標，把 AI 視為電網系統的大腦，透過監控數據的模式和趨勢， AI 可以在潛在問題發生之前，就辨識出來，並採取糾正措施以避免中斷。或遇到突發狀況能夠在最短時間即時做出最適當的能源分配決策，確保電網的穩定。例如利用[監控和資料擷取系統](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/SCADA-supervisory-control-and-data-acquisition) ( Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition, SCADA)、維護和預知數據來防止短缺或電網故障。
4. 機構能源使用與應用發展最佳化：以目前深度學習人工智慧演算法的預測能力，已被大家認為將比所有行業專家的總和還要精準，且預測方式可應用在各種不同形式上，如進一步結合用電與政府需量競價、綠電使用與販售及製氫、參與輔助服務市場、整合製程用電供需管理等等的綜合應用，可使企業在售購電與電能轉換應用大大增加靈活使用彈性，創造最大能源與經濟效益。
5. 減少人力：能源管理行業需要大量的精力和時間。利用 AI 技術，可以減輕能源管理員工的工作負擔，減少勞動量，同時還可以歸結從事管理的人力、時間、資源等成本和開銷。

**二****、AI在能源領域的應用伴隨之風險與挑戰**

1. 高成本：AI 需要大量的數據資源來訓練和運行模型，且具備高效能的運算能力才易彰顯功效，高運算力就需有高階前端的相關硬體設備做支撐，如近期高階 AI 晶片在售價與需求屢創新高，可見一般；而 AI 系統運作時更會產生大量的資料，這時亦需要物聯網的支援。所以 AI 系統的開發和應用皆需要大量的人力、物力和財力，高昂的成本是使用 AI 在能源領域時會面臨的一大挑戰。
2. 電力需求：當 AI 利用大量的數據訓練和驗證模型的執行階段，需要耗費很多電力能源，根據 [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/) 在2019年發表的一篇文章，提及 [Massachusetts 大學](https://www.massachusetts.edu/)的研究人員，針對幾種常見的大型 AI 模型進行的生命週期評估，以 Transformer 模型為例，將訓練此模型過程中所消耗的總能源根據美國的平均能源結構，換算成 lbs CO2 當量，得出此訓練過程會排放超過 62.6 萬磅的二氧化碳當量，這相當於平均人類一年生活所排放二氧化碳量的57 倍；美國人一年生活碳排的 17 倍；一台美國汽車包含製造的生命週期碳排放量的 5 倍，如圖一所示。可以見得，AI系統的高耗能將對能源系統造成另一股壓力，並導致不必要的能源浪費，對環境帶來衝擊。
3. 資訊安全風險：如同前面所提，AI系統除了需要具備高速、大容量的數據存儲設施以及強大的數據分析和處理能力外，所產生出來的大數據也很容易受到駭客和網絡攻擊的威脅。為了需要保障資料、模型和系統的安全，因此需要具備高效強大的安全防護及維護措施，防止敏感數據遭到盜取或損毀。

但整體看來，AI 在能源領域的應用帶來的利應大於弊。從新能源開發、設計能源系統、能源供輸調配分析，到能源管理的 AI 應用，隨著科技進展發現有越來越多有效案例與潛在應用，更加深 AI 技術為能源轉型帶來新契機的期待。而在成本、資安、耗能碳排部分，更加希望能藉由技術的突破，降低AI運用成本、強化資料安全，更重要的是降低運算能耗，減少二氧化碳排放，為潔淨能源使用和地球環境帶來更大的實質效益。

由于伯克希尔·哈撒韦能源公司（BHE）这家发电量高达30吉瓦的公司“盈利不佳”，巴菲特在今年的[致股东信](https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3708962?keyword=%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9)中表示：**美国电网的未来需求和相应的资本支出将是惊人的。**该观点随后引发了对美国电网稳定性和未来电力需求的广泛关注。

巴菲特的担忧并非空穴来风，近年来，对美国“电网危机”的担忧持续蔓延。据美国电力预测，对美国未来五年电力需求增长的预测比一年前翻了一番。

## AI数据中心将成耗电主力

有媒体此前评论称，美国正面临一场迫在眉睫的电网危机，可能比气候危机更为紧迫。文章指出，新的AI数据中心、联邦政府补贴下的工厂生产和政府推动的电动汽车转型将是导致电力需求激增的主要原因。

**其中尤其是AI数据中心，预计将对美国电网造成前所未有的压力。**

目前，风能和太阳能等可再生能源无法提供这种稳定性，建设连接远程可再生能源到电网的输电线路需要长达10至12年的时间，因此，电力将在中短期内将是供应数据中心的主要能源角色。

并且，支持AI训练阶段的数据中心功耗可达80千瓦，支持AI推理阶段的数据中心功耗为其一半，**无AI需求的数据中心仅仅是其八分之一**——因此，在缺乏更高效的训练和推理过程的情况下，AI的进一步发展将导致数据中心的消耗增加，电力需求增加。

## 下一个AI交易——能源

在这种背景下，投资者和分析师正在寻找与AI相关的新的投资机会。

高盛分析师Louis Miller在最新的研报中指出，**随着AI基础设施建设的推进，电力基础设施和能源领域将成为一大交易主题：**

> “整个人工智能堆栈的焦点已经从软件和AI工具转移到硬件，其中‘赢家通吃’的状态可能会减少，市场上的许多现有企业都具备通过AI增利的潜力。因此，**我们预计以硬件和电力为导向的行业将赶上更广泛的人工智能主题。**”

具体而言，Miller认为，可以关注智能电网基础设施（权重30%）、非监管类公用事业（权重25%）、发电原材料（权重25%）以及其他公用事业（权重20%）四大领域，这些领域的公司可能会因电力需求的增长而获得新订单和收入来源。

此外，报告称，随着电力需求的增长，**铜和铀等发电原材料的需求也预计将激增。**

据悉，这些材料对于电力传输和新核电站的建设至关重要。因此，相关材料的生产商也可能成为投资者的新宠。

报告总结称：

> “短期内，无论软件公司是否成功推出他们的AI产品，硬件和电力公司都将在这场竞赛中获胜。”


# AI与能源
鉴于地球上已知的**化石能源根本不可能满足未来AI的能源需求**，“新能源能力”将成为除科技外另一把“掌握未来算力的关键钥匙”，**核能和光伏或将成为破局的两大关键**。

2022年出现的ChatGPT惊艳全球，今年，主角咖位被Sora取代。业界预测，快则2年，慢则8年，真正意义上的人工通用智能（AGI）就会实现。

随着AI浪头扬起，其所带来的能源压力也受到关注。**OpenAI首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼日前公开表示，人工智能行业正在走向能源危机。他警告说：“下一波生成式人工智能系统消耗的电力将远远超出预期，现有能源系统将难以应对。”**

AI的“尽头”是能源吗？

众所周知，AI拼的是算力。而要提高算力水平有两个途径，其**一是提高芯片等硬科技水平**，其二便是**以大量数据“喂养”算法，助其快快长大。而要实现后者，稳定持续的电力供应必不可少。**

事实上，现阶段就开始担忧AI能源供给并不是杞人忧天。

**今年以来，仅ChatGPT每月消耗的电力就相当于约30万中国家庭一个月的用电量，而且这一数据随着ChatGPT的迭代还在迅速上升。**

宾夕法尼亚大学的研究也显示，**2018年，计算机只用掉了全球不到2%的电力；但今天，这个比重已增长至10%；预计到2030年，计算机将会消耗全球五分之一的电力。**

那么，**未来的算力会需要多少能源呢？多位业内专家预测，至少需要消耗“地球已知化石能源储量的两倍”。据美媒报道，有专家甚至表示，它会“烧掉14个地球”**。

就此，专家纷纷建言献策。大家共同的观点是，鉴于化石能源根本不可能满足AI的需求，“新能源能力”将成为除科技以外另一把“掌握未来算力的关键钥匙”。
>  非常滑稽的，现在能源转型尚且不能达成，现在还想用新能源去支撑AI技术的发展
>  我们的逻辑是，新能源支撑不了这个更加庞大的能源需求，所以煤电退不了
>  而他们的逻辑是，传统的化石能源支撑不了新能源，所以要发展新能源



目前最具可行性的能源“钥匙”有望出现在两个领域。

第一个是核能。福岛核事故后，全球核能何去何从成为各方关注的焦点。尽管多国政府事实上仍在发展核能，但面对公众的时候普遍表现得比较低调。原因无他，怕引发公众的恐慌情绪。

事实上，最近半个多世纪以来，核能一直作为一种便宜清洁的能源在全球范围内发展。目前，核能提供了全球13.8%的电力供应，大多数核电站都分布在发达国家。同时，因为核电站不产生二氧化碳，发展核能也被视为应对气候变化的一种有效方法。

最近核能领域还传来了一个好消息，即有“人造太阳”之称的可控核聚变技术取得了新进展。此前，核电的技术原理基本都基于核裂变。该技术很早就取得了突破，但安全性不高，历史上几次核灾难本质上都是核裂变惹的祸。核聚变则不然，**可控二字就是其本质特征，只不过目前其研究尚处于实验室阶段，成本和效率问题都亟待破解，距离商用尚有不小的距离。不过，从去年以来，海内外核聚变研究纷纷取得突破，“人造太阳”离照亮人类未来越来越近**。

第二个是光伏。从产业规模角度看，2022年全球新增光伏装机量预计为230吉瓦，同比增长35.3%，拉动光伏产业链制造端产能进一步扩大。从生产布局角度看，中国大陆依然是产能最大聚集地，硅片产能占全球硅片总产能的比重高达98%，电池片产能占比超过85%，组件产能占比约为77%。从国别（地区）角度看，欧洲的发展前景比较乐观。2022年，欧盟新增光伏装机量41.4吉瓦，同比涨幅接近50%，预计2026年光伏年新增装机量将接近120吉瓦。此外巴西光伏装机量达到22吉瓦，新增9.0吉瓦，新增装机量同比大幅增长73.3%；印度新增装机量达到13.96吉瓦，同比增长近40%。比较“掉链子”的是美国。美国光伏市场是为数不多出现衰退的市场，由于对华贸易限制阻碍了光伏设备中关键的低成本零配件和材料进口，2022年美国光伏新增装机量同比降低23%。
> 1_吉瓦_=10亿瓦=1 000兆瓦=1百万_千瓦_。1000 000
> 1 gw=1,000 mw
> 1 mw=1,000 kw
> 1 kw = 1,000 w
> 中国一年用电 13524亿千瓦时 = 1352.4 gwh



当然，谈论光伏产业就不能不谈储能。对于天然具有发电间歇性特点的新能源来说，找到一个中间体或关键枢纽完成能量存储至关重要。如果没有储能系统的参与，新能源就会陷入供应与使用不“合拍”、时间与空间不连续的尴尬境地，自然也无法发挥最大效能。从这个意义上讲，发展储能的重要性不亚于发展新能源产业本身。
