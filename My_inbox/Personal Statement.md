With the development of China, I have had the opportunity to engage with the trend of global globalization, learning English and exploring cultures from around the world. Through reading books, watching videos (such as the TV series _Friends_), and conversing directly with foreign friends, through whihc I have gotten more and more intersted about this , about this diverse world.
For example, reading books like _On China_ by Henry Kissinger has allowed me to take a more objective perspective on China and its place in the global context. These experiences have helped me broaden my view and recognize the complexity of international relations.More than that ,I firmly believed that all human beings should be equal, regardless of nationality, race, or background.As the _Declaration of Independence_ states, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.“I wholeheartedly embrace this belief and hold it as a core principle in how I view the world and human relationships.

Thus,I am excited to apply for the Policy and Research Intern position because I am deeply motivated to contribute to evidence-based policy development and make a meaningful impact on society. And I am eager to engage in research that supports global progress and informed decision-making. This internship offers the perfect opportunity for me to apply my skills in research and data analysis while working in an international and policy-focused environment.

I have previously worked on data analysis projects, where I gained valuable experience in collecting, processing, and interpreting complex datasets to extract actionable insights. I am confident that my analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work with various research methodologies will allow me to contribute effectively to your team. Additionally, I have developed a solid understanding of how data-driven research can shape policies that address pressing social issues. I am particularly drawn to this position because it aligns with my passion for using research to drive positive change in society.


The treasure of human spiritual civilization fascinates me a lot.The United Nations is a pioneering work of human civilization, and I am looking forward to participating in it and making my own contribution. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the goals of your organization.

I am truly excited to apply for the Policy and Research Intern position, as it aligns perfectly with my passion for using data to drive meaningful change and my practical experience in data analysis.
统计是我的major，我很认真的学习了统计知识，形成了扎实的数据分析能力，掌握了R 和python这样的数据分析工具。在学校里我参加过数据分析大赛，例如，我们的小组通过使用聚类等机器学习统计方法研究数据集为商业决策提供支持。此外，我研究生学的是经济，主要研究能源经济领域，在经济研究方法，我将统计知识积极的运用到实践中去。用Stata R 等做回归分析，形成了一篇工作论文。我对数据分析抱有极大的兴趣，我自己也尝试用自己的统计知识去分析中国的经济形式。了解到这个实习岗位是在实践中对于数据分析的应用，我非常感兴趣，我认为这是一个很好的能够将我的能力发挥出来做一些贡献的机会。


Using Python & R, visualizations were created to help the team make data-driven decisions, resulting in a measurable improvement in performance. This experience has deepened my understanding of how powerful data can be when used strategically to solve real-world problems, further fueling my desire to apply these skills in policy research.Additionally, in previous research projects, statistical analysis was applied to evaluate societal trends.  R is utilized to perform regression analysis and hypothesis testing, enabling meaningful conclusions to be drawn from complex datasets. The ability to turn raw data into actionable insights is something I greatly enjoy, and I am confident that this skill will enable me to support your team in crafting robust, evidence-based policy recommendations.I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis to a field that has such a direct and lasting impact on society.
