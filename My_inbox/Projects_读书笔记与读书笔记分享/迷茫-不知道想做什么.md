> [!NOTE] 你热衷什么？
> 首先是一个现象：
> 很大部分人不知道自己热衷于什么，同时不知道自己的热情所在。
> 举例来说，在小时候，我们都去追星，但有的人就这么爱追星，以至于要把明星刻在自己的身上或者刻在桌子上，但我就没有这么这么的爱。这样看起来，我真的很无趣是么。
> 其次，为了解决这一困难，社会上有一个很有意思的观点”你只有一桩热情，你的任务就是去找到它、追寻它，并排除其他的一切。如果你那么做了，一切都将水到渠成。但如果你没找到，你就失败了“。
> 作者对此也是疑虑重重，在本科的时候换过两次专业，然后步入职场，先做了文职的工作，后来呢被邀请做珠宝的工作，发现珠宝的工作还挺有意思的。开始的时候，作者担心疑虑”这个是不是自己终身的热情所在“，后来，作者开始尝试体验，珠宝行业虽然不是他的热情所在，但后来她发现也是有趣的。
> 最后有几点建议：
> 
你知道为什么吗？因为最令人满意的关系，最成功的事业，是那些仍会为你带来惊讶的。至于你已经知道你想做的事——你想要写本书，开始做生意，或是转换职业轨道... 很好！**但如果你只是坐等热情自动现身，那你要等上相当长的时间。所以别等了。**
**花时间关注在解决你喜欢的问题上，找出待解决的问题。做个有用的人，慷慨一些。人们会感激拥抱你，并付你钱。而且那就是你的热爱所在。当你的工夫精力符合别人的需求，你就会明白：你的热情所在和你要奉献什么。**
当我们在问别人热衷于什么的时候，他们回答：“帮助其他人。”对此你会怎么看？所以别再等了。听我母亲的，就做吧。因为**人生要过得充满意义和价值，你不是要跟着你的热情走，而是热情会追随着你而来。**
你热衷什么? 我们被告知这五个字是实现事业成功和人生目标的关键。但如果它是个伪命题呢? 我们许多人大学毕业后、或工作很长一段时间后，仍不知道自己想做什么。对此，你是不是很焦虑？相信我，你不是一个人。演讲者Terri Trespicio在26岁时失去了工作，也不知道自己想做什么，每天沉迷于电视剧，和对热情的思考中无法走出。最终，妈妈的话点醒了她。回顾自己的经历，她认识到：**一切你应该做的事，要完全契合热情的想法是不现实的，不是热情创造成功，而是成功创造热情。如果你曾因找不到自己的热情所在而迷茫**，请一定要看这个演讲！

双语演讲稿


  

The day I got laid off from my job at Martha Stewart, I was relieved. (Laughter) I loved the job, I really did. But the relationship was over and I didn't know how to end it and then it broke up with me. Don’t you love it when that happens?

在被玛莎·史都华裁员的那一天，我松了一口气。我曾经爱我的工作，真的爱过。但爱意已然不在，我却不知道怎么样来结束它。我被分手了，其实这样发生也不错吧？

  

At the time I’ve been also hosting a radio show for the Martha Stewart brand on Sirius XM. And then not long after that got cancelled, too. On the day of my last show I got onto the elevator at the 36th floor and as it started to drop, I started to cry.

那时我还在天狼星卫星广播里，主持一档玛莎·史都华品牌的专栏节目。我被解雇后不久，这档栏目也被砍掉了。做完最后一期节目，我踏上停在36 层楼的电梯，当电梯开始下降时，我哭了。

  

Every floor took me further and further from what I had been: a magazine editor, a radio host, the person with the cool job to talk about at parties. You know. And honestly I had no idea what I was going to do. And quite frankly no one was looking for me.

我离曾经的工作越来越远：杂志编辑、电台主持，这些在聚会上说出来都令人羡慕的工作。你懂的。实话说我并没有想好未来的路。而且坦率来讲，也没有工作来找我。

  

So, I did what anyone would do in that situation. I was making some phone calls: “Hey, what are you up to? Did I mention I’m available?” I needed to get paid to do something, right. I mean I live in New York City. If you’re not paid to do something, you’re not going to be there very long.

所以，我做了这种时候大家可能都会做的事。我开始打电话：“嘿，最近怎样？我有提我在找工作吗？”我需要赚点钱，是的。我的意思是我住在纽约。如果没收入的话，是没法在那儿生活太久的。

  

But this idea that I had to know what I suppose to do now, right. I’m supposed to pursue this passion. It’s just bugged me. It always had. And that’s because it’s a dangerously limiting idea at the heart of everything we believe about success and life in general.

但我必须知道我现在该怎样，我应该追随热情。这一直困扰着我，从没停止过。总的来说，我们相信依照爱好是所有成功和人生的关键，这是一个危险的局限性想法。

  

And it’s that you have one singular passion and your job is to find it and to pursue it to the exclusion of all else. And if you do that everything will fall into place and if you don’t you failed.

**就好像你只有一桩热情，你的任务就是去找到它、追寻它，并排除其他的一切。如果你那么做了，一切都将水到渠成。但如果你没找到，你就失败了。**

The pressure starts really young and it goes your whole life, but it’s perhaps most pronounced when you’re graduating from school. After this, “Wow, the world's at your feet! What are you going to do now?” And it’s so intimidating, it's like picking a major for life.

而且压力会在很年轻的时候就出现，并会伴随一生。也许你在毕业的时候感受尤其明显。**走出校门，“哇，世界在你脚下！你打算干点什么？”其实挺心虚的，就像要为人生选一个专业。**

  

You know, I had a hard enough time picking a major for four years and I changed that once, if not twice. I mean it was like just intimidating, right? And this compelling I mean this really, you know, forceful cultural imperative to choose your passion, it’s stressful to me, but it’s not just me, it’s everyone I talk to agrees with me.

要知道大学四年的专业我选得多么困难，至少换过一次，没准是两次。我的意思是很恐怖，而且是强制的，我的意思是这次是来真的。**强势的文化迫使我们尽快选出热情，这让我倍感压力，而且不仅仅是我，每一个聊到的朋友都表示赞同。**

  

The woman who sold me this dress. I told her what I needed the dress for, what I was talking about and she said, “Oh my gosh, I really need to hear this talk, because I just graduate from school. My friends and I we don’t know what we’re passionate about, we don’t know what we supposed to do.”

我告诉卖给我这件洋装的女士，洋装是为了TED演讲而准备，以及我将要演讲的主题。她说：“天呀！我真的需要去听这场演讲，我和朋友刚毕业，真的不知道我们对什么热情，也不知道什么是应该做的。”

  

I’m leery of passion for a few reasons. But one of them is that passion is not a plan, it’s a feeling. And feelings change. They do. You can be passionate about a person one day, a job, and then not passionate the next. We know this and yet we continue to use passion as the yardstick to judge everything by, instead of seeing passion for what it really is: the fire that ignites when you start rubbing sticks together.

对于爱好我很谨慎，其中一个原因是它不是计划，而是一种感觉。感觉会改变，真的会。你可以喜欢一个人或是一份工作，可能第二天便热情不再。**我们对此心知肚明，但是我们还是继续将热情作为准绳去判断一切，而不是看清热情是什么和为了什么：热情是钻木取火而燃起的火苗。**

  

Anyway, I was such a mess when I was in my twenties, such a mess. I was anxious and depressed and had no life to speak of, I was temping to keep my options open, and I was sitting around at night in my underwear watching Seinfeld reruns. Actually I still do that, that’s not the worst thing in the world to do. It’s fine. But I called my mother every night crying

其实我在二十几岁时一团糟，相当糟糕。我感到焦虑和沮丧，没有生命可言，我很想让自己的选择保持开放；晚上我穿着内衣坐着看《欢乐单身派对》重播——事实上我仍然如此，其实这不算最糟，也还好——更糟的是我每晚打电话跟我妈哭诉。

  

And I was turning away perfectly good full-time jobs. Why? Because I was afraid. I was sure that I would pick the wrong one and get on the wrong train headed to the wrong future. My mother begged me, she said, “Please, take a job, any job. You’re not going to be stuck, you’re stuck now!

我拒绝很棒的全职工作，为什么？因为我害怕。我确信我会选到错误的那一个，像搭上开往黑暗未来的错误火车。我妈哀求我：“求你了，就选个工作吧，什么工作都行。你不会被卡住，你已经卡住了！

  

You don’t create your life first, and then live it. You create it by living it, not agonizing about it.” She’s right, she’s always right.

**你不是先创造生活，然后活下去。你通过生活来创造它，而不是为它而痛苦。**” 她是对的，她一直都对。

And so I took a full-time job as an assistant at a management consulting firm, where I knew nothing about nothing. Okay. Zero. Except I knew I had a reason to get up in the morning, get showered, leave the house, people who were waiting for me when I got there and I got a paycheck every two weeks. And that is as good a reason to take a job as any.

所以我找了个全职的助理工作，在一家管理顾问公司。说实话，我一点都不懂，一无所知。但这给了我早起、洗澡还有出门的理由。当我到公司的时候有人在等我，而且我两周领一次薪水。对我来说，这是上班的够好理由了。

  

Did I know that I want to be an office administrator for the rest of my life? No! I had no idea! Truly! But this idea that everything you're supposed to do should fit into this passion vertical is unrealistic. And I’ll say it - elitist. You show me someone who washes windows for a living and I will bet you a million dollars it’s not because he has a passion for clean glass.

难道我知道这个行政工作我能一直干下去？不！我不知道！真的！但是**一切你应该做的事要完全契合热情的想法是不现实的。** 我会对你说，你找一个靠清洗玻璃为生的人，而我敢跟你赌一百万，这不会因为他酷爱擦玻璃。

  

One of my favorite columns is a piece by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. He wrote a piece in The Wall Street Journal a few years ago, about how he failed his way to success. And one of his jobs was a commercial loan officer. And he was taught specifically: "Do not loan money to someone following their passion." No, loan it to someone who wants to start a business, the more boring, the better. Adam says that in his life success fueled passion more than passion fueled success.

我最喜欢的一篇专栏文章出自“呆伯特”的作者斯科特·亚当斯。几年前他为《华尔街日报》写过一篇文章，说他如何一路失败走上成功之道。他曾经做过商业贷款专员。他接受的培训很明确地说：“千万别放贷给跟着自己的热情走的人。”反而放贷给那些创业案子中看起来无聊的越好。亚当斯说在他的生活中成功为热情助力的时候多于热情为成功助力。

  

When I got my first job as a magazine editor, in publishing, I was thrilled. But I had to take pretty big pay cut, because at the time I’d been a catalogue copywriter at a wig company. (Laughter) Laugh if you will, clearly you are and many, many people did. But wigs paid. So I had to figure out a way to make some money.

当我得到在出版业的第一份工作——杂志编辑，我非常开心。但薪水骤减，因为我在这之前在一家假发公司做商品目录编辑。笑吧，大家都会笑。但是假发公司待遇不错。所以我得另找路子赚些钱。

  

A friend of mine invited me to a jewelry party I said, "What is a jewelry party?" She said, “It’s like Tupperware but with bracelets.” I said, “Okay, got it, got it.” I went and I had the best time. I was there hanging out, trying on jewelry, the salespersons having a great time and I was like, "That’s a job. I could... I could do that."

朋友邀请我参加一个珠宝派对。我问她：“什么是珠宝派对？”她说：“就像特百惠展销，但是卖的是手镯。”我说：“好的，我明白了。”我在那里很开心，到处闲逛，试戴珠宝。销售人员也很开心，然后我猛地一想：“那也是份工作。也许我... 也许我能做那个。”

  

I mean, really, she seems to be having a great time. Now, I had no background in sales, unless you count Girl Scouts, and I was terrible. And I had no passion for jewelry. I mean, honestly, my earrings cost 20 $. Combined, all of them. And yet I was like, "I think I can sling silver jewelry to suburban moms drinking daiquiris. Yes, I could do that."

我说真的，她看上去做得很开心。我没有任何销售背景，除非算上女童军经历，我的表现也很糟。而且我也不喜欢珠宝。实话说，我的耳环20元买的，是全部的加起来喔。我突然想到：“我应该可以把银饰卖给住郊区、喝着鸡尾酒的那些妈妈们。是的，那个我能做。”

  

And so I did it, I signed up, I became a Silpada Designs rep. And I… Listen to me, I was not setting a world on fire right away. Really. I was so awkward and afraid of selling. And then I got better, I got better, I started making some money, I started getting really passionate about it.

我做了，我加入Silpada Designs珠宝公司。而且…听我说，我不是马上就一鸣惊人。事实上，面对客户的时候我感到尴尬畏怯。**但后来情况好一些了，再后来更好了，我开始赚钱，我也开始对它感兴趣了**。


Not just because of the money, but because what I realized was people wanted the stuff. They were happy to pay for it. I sold so much jewelry that year I won a free trip to Saint Thomas. (Laughter) It’s true. I eventually let my jewelry business go, because my career path shifted. But I was so glad that I did that. Because it planted an entrepreneurial seed I didn’t know was there. And that bears fruit to this day.

不仅仅是因为钱，也是因为**我了解到人们想要这些物品，他们也开心花钱买下它**。我那一年业绩傲人，赢得了免费圣托马斯岛之旅。是真的。**我最终离开珠宝行业，因为我的职业道路转移了**。但我很高兴我做过那行，因为它种下了一粒我原来不知道的创业种子，因而无心插柳柳成荫。
  

Now as you know an entire cottage industry has sprung up around helping people find their passions, right. Books, coaching, webinars, whatever. And their hearts in the right place, it’s great, I’m all about self-discovery.

目前，如你所知，**整个家庭工业正如雨后春笋般涌现，来帮助人们找到自己的热情，不论是书籍、培训、网路研讨，只要他们初衷正确，就是好的，而我是自我发现型的**。


But when you ask someone, or you’re asked like, "What’s your passion?" It’s triggering. It’s like, "Oh my god, I have to came out with a good answer for this."

但是当你问某人，或是你被问：“你热衷的是什么？”那会触发像“天哪，我得拿出个好答案。”

  

One of my friends in her mid-forties and she’s looking what’s her life going to be now. And she’s like, “I don’t know what I’m passionate about.” And she’s legitimately concerned about this. She’s ready to hire a team of people.

我有个朋友，四十几岁，到现在还在寻找她的人生方向。她说：“我不知道我热衷什么。”而且她很理性地关注这方面。她准备雇用一队人（帮她找）。

  

It’s like, why are we worrying about this? You know why, because she thinks something wrong with her. I thought something was wrong with me when I was in the seventh grade and everyone was really into like the rock-bands and their actors and they would carve the names of those bands in a tables in a library. And I never carved anything, because I couldn’t think of anything to carve.

为什么我们会担心？你知道原因，那就是她觉得自己不太对劲。**我在七年级时也有这种感觉。而我周围的人痴迷于摇滚乐团和明星，他们在图书馆桌子上刻偶像的名字。我从没那样干过，因为我想不出刻什么**。

  

I mean I liked Bon Jovi as much as the next girl, but not enough to deface school propriety, you know. It’s probably why I don’t have any tattoos either. I’m assuming that’s why. I was really boring, I thought something was wrong with me. But that’s the fear, isn’t it?

我和邻桌的女孩一样喜欢邦·乔维，但喜爱的程度不足以让我损坏学校公物。可能这也是我没有纹身的原因。我猜这就是原因。我真的很无趣，我觉得自己真的有问题。就是这样的恐惧，对吧？

  

That when someone asks you at a party, on a date, at a job interview, "What are you passionate about?" That you're not going to have this wow compelling answer. And that means that you’re not interesting, or ambitious, or that you don’t have a singular obsession or scary talent that you hiding. And that your life isn’t worth living.

当你参加聚会、约会，或是面试时，总有人会问：“你热衷什么？”你却不能给出令人惊艳的答案。这就意味着你不是有趣或是有抱负的人，或者你没有任何隐藏的痴迷或惊人的天赋，你白活了。

  

And it’s not true. Passion is not a job, a sport, or a hobby. It is the full force of your attention and energy that you give to whatever is right in front of you. And if you’re so busy looking for this passion, you could miss opportunities that change your life. You could also miss out on a great love. Because that’s what happens when you have tunnel vision, trying to find the One.

但没这回事。热情不是工作、运动或爱好。热情是你注意力和精力的全部力量，投注于你面前的任何东西。**如果你忙于寻找这热情，就可能会错过改变人生的机会，也可能错过一段好姻缘。** 因为视野不够开阔，忙着找到“对的那一个”，就可能会这样。

  

We all think we know the kind of person we are and the kind of person we could love. But sometimes we’re wrong. Blissfully wrong. And sometimes you don’t know what you're going to do next, right? I mean, I don’t. I love not knowing what I’m going to be doing five years from now or I will be into. And that’s okay, it’s okay not to know.

我们都以为自知是哪种类型的人，我们会爱上什么样的人。但是有时我们错了。也错得很开心。而且有时你不知道下一步该做什么，对吧？我就不知道。我并不想知道接下来五年我要做什么，或者我会投入什么。不知道也没什么大不了的。

  

You know why? Because the most fulfilling relationships, the most fulfilling careers are those that still have the power to surprise you. And as for the things you know you want to do. You want to write a book, you want to start a business, you want to change careers. Great! But if you’re sitting around waiting for passion to show up and take it, you’re going to be waiting a long time. So don’t wait.

你知道为什么吗？因为最令人满意的关系，最成功的事业，是那些仍会为你带来惊讶的。至于你已经知道你想做的事——你想要写本书，开始做生意，或是转换职业轨道... 很好！**但如果你只是坐等热情自动现身，那你要等上相当长的时间。所以别等了。**

  

Instead, spend your time and attention solving your favorite problems. Look for problems that need solving. Be useful, generous. People will thank you, and hug you and pay you for it and that’s where passion is. Where your energy and effort meets someone else’s need. That’s when you realize: passion lives, and realizing what you have to contribute.

**花时间关注在解决你喜欢的问题上，找出待解决的问题。做个有用的人，慷慨一些。人们会感激拥抱你，并付你钱。而且那就是你的热爱所在。当你的工夫精力符合别人的需求，你就会明白：你的热情所在和你要奉献什么。**

  

Why do you think when we’re asking people what they’re passionate about, they say, "Helping other people."? So don’t wait. Listen to my mother. Just start doing. Because to live a life full of meaning and value , you don’t follow you passion, your passion follows you. 

当我们在问别人热衷于什么的时候，他们回答：“帮助其他人。”对此你会怎么看？所以别再等了。听我母亲的，就做吧。因为**人生要过得充满意义和价值，你不是要跟着你的热情走，而是热情会追随着你而来。**

Thank you.
