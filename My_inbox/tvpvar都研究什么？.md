# 1 Dynamic interlinkages between carbon risk and volatility of green and renewable energy: A TVP-VAR analysis

The interconnectedness amid **stock markets and products** have been addressed by many studies in the forms of transmissions, volatility and correlations using multivariate models.

**The risk of spillover is one of the major concerns with the nexus amid the carbon and the energy sectors**, and some of the studies have attempted to address this in the recent decades, Arouri et al. (2012) investigated **the volatility spillover of oil process with the financial markets in Europe and observed volatility connectedness in these markets**

For example, using the newly developed quantile VAR (QVAR) model in China, Wu et al. (2023) observed bigger **total spillovers between carbon and commodity markets** in both tails than that at the middle quantile. s. Ha (2023) used multivariate wavelet analysis and explored the interlinks and frequency dimensions **among green and renewable energy and carbon risk** for the 7 February 2017 – 13 June 2022 period during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The study found a significant **nexus amid the solar energy index, envitec biogas, biofuels, geothermal energy, and carbon emission futures** from early 2020 to middle 2022. Also, the partial coherencies observed among these indicators during the conflict from early April 2022 to the end of April 2022 implied an in-phase relationship of carbon emission futures with S&P global clean energy index pushing.
