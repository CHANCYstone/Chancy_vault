# DATA

### 1. 时间的跨度span 和频度 frequency

The research selects the **monthly data** between **January 2014 and October 2022** to analyse the correlation among artificial intelligence,supply chain and energy sustainability from a global perspective.

### 2.数据的选择

#### 1. GEUI
Thereafter, the research chooses the **Global Energy-Related Uncertainty Index (GEUI)** to reflect **energy sustainability** across the world (Dang et al., 2023), and this data is acquired from the **Economic Policy Uncertainty Database.**

#### 2. GSCPI
After that, the research applies the **Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI)** to reflect this situation, and the data is obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Qin et al., 2023c). This indicator combines the Air Cargo Cost Index, the Harpex Index and the Baltic Dry Index, as well as some components of the Purchasing Managers’ Index in 7 economies.

#### 3. AII
Further, this period is accompanied by the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and we choose the **Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Kensho New Economy RAIC Index (AII)** to represent it,which is acquired from the S&P Dow Jones Indices Website

This indicator is designed to measure the performance of 9 industry segments, including enterprises involved in the robotics, artificial intelligence and cloud industries, which is obtained by using equal weight. In this way,we would identify the interrelationship among AII, GSCPI and GEUI, the trends of these three sequences are depicted in the following figure.
