以下是针对雅思口语Part 2中科学主题描述的**结构化模板**，覆盖四个核心问题，并适配多种学科（生物、机器人、物理等），方便你灵活替换内容反复使用：

---

### **1. Which subject it is**  
**核心句**：  

> [!NOTE]
> 陈述+定于从句

"The scientific field I’m passionate about is **[学科名称]**, which focuses on **[简明定义/核心目标]**."  
**扩展方向**：  
- **学科定义**：用1句解释其核心（e.g., "a branch of...", "aims to..."）。  
- **学科意义**：点出它解决的问题或对人类的价值（e.g., "revolutionizing..."）。  
**例句**：  
> *"The scientific field I’m passionate about is **astrobiology**, which explores the origins and potential of life in the universe, merging biology, chemistry, and astronomy to answer humanity’s oldest question: ‘Are we alone?’"*  

---

### **2. When and where you came to know this subject**  
**核心句**：  
"I first discovered this field **[具体时间/场景]**, when **[触发事件]**."  

> [!NOTE]
> xxx at some place when. 定于从句+自由发挥

**扩展方向**：  
- **时间/地点**：具体化（e.g., "during a high school field trip", "while volunteering at a lab"）。  
- **触发事件**：描述引发兴趣的瞬间（e.g., 听讲座、看纪录片、亲身经历）。  
**例句**：  
> *"I was introduced to robotics **at a tech expo in Shanghai two years ago**, where I witnessed a bionic arm controlled by brain signals—it felt like witnessing the future of human-machine interaction."*  

---

### **3. How you got information about this subject**  


> [!NOTE] Title

**例句**：  
> *"I immersed myself in online courses like edX’s ‘AI Ethics’, read journals such as ‘Science Robotics’, and even built a simple sensor-based robot with a Raspberry Pi—hands-on trials taught me far more than textbooks alone."*  

---

### **4. Why you are interested in this subject**  
**核心句**：  

> [!NOTE]
> "What truly captivates me is **[兴趣根源：学科特性/个人共鸣]**."

- **未来愿景**：点出学科潜力或你想参与的方向。  
**例句**：  
> *"I’m drawn to renewable energy engineering because it merges innovation with urgency—designing solar grids isn’t just technical; it’s a fight against climate change. Plus, growing up in a coal-mining region, I’ve seen firsthand why sustainable alternatives matter."*  

---

### **完整结构示例（替换[ ]内容即可）**  
"The subject I’m fascinated by is **[X]**, which **[定义/意义]**. I first learned about it **[时间/场景+触发事件]**. To explore it further, I **[资源/方法]**. Ultimately, what hooks me is **[兴趣原因+个人联系]**."  

---

### **加分技巧**  
1. **数据/名称增强可信度**：提及具体学者、机构或技术术语（e.g., "MIT’s OpenCourseWare", "CRISPR-Cas9"）。  
2. **对比与类比**：用“Unlike...”, “Similar to...”体现批判性思维。  
3. **价值观升华**：将兴趣关联到社会影响（环保、医疗公平等），展现深度。  

按此结构，只需替换学科名称和细节，即可快速生成高分回答。保持自然口语化，避免背诵感！
