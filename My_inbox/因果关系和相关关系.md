# AI explanation

As Super Bowl point differences widen, more players invest in luxury real estate, driving up demand and prices in affluent areas like Connecticut. Remember, in the game of real estate, it's all about that super buying power!

**Correlation r = 0.7873385** ([Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient))  
Correlation is a measure of how much the variables move together. If it is 0.99, when one goes up the other goes up. If it is 0.02, the connection is very weak or non-existent. If it is -0.99, then when one goes up the other goes down. If it is 1.00, you probably messed up your correlation function.  
  
**r2 = 0.6199020** ([Coefficient of determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination))  
This means **62%** of the change in the one variable _(i.e., Highest sale price for a single-family home in Connecticut)_ is predictable based on the change in the other _(i.e., Super Bowl point difference)_ over the 16 years from 2006 through 2021.  
  
**p < 0.01,** which is statistically significant([Null hypothesis significance test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value))  
The _p_-value is 0.00029.Show The _p_-value is a measure of how probable it is that we would randomly find a result this extreme.Note On average, you will find a correaltion as strong as 0.79 in 0.029% of random cases. Said differently, if you correlated 3,398 random variablesNote with the same 15 degrees of freedom, Note you would randomly expect to find a correlation as strong as this one.  
  
**[ 0.48, 0.92 ] 95% correlation [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval)** (using the [Fisher z-transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation))

# Why this works

1. **Data dredging:** I have 25,153 variables in my database. I compare all these variables against each other to find ones that randomly match up. That's 632,673,409 correlation calculations! This is called “data dredging.” Instead of starting with a hypothesis and testing it, I instead abused the data to see what correlations shake out. It’s a dangerous way to go about analysis, because any sufficiently large dataset will yield strong correlations completely at random.
2. **Lack of causal connection:** There is probablyNote no direct connection between these variables, despite what the AI says above. This is exacerbated by the fact that I used "Years" as the base variable. Lots of things happen in a year that are not related to each other! Most studies would use something like "one person" in stead of "one year" to be the "thing" studied.
3. **Observations not independent:** For many variables, sequential years are not independent of each other. If a population of people is continuously doing something every day, there is no reason to think they would suddenly _change_ how they are doing that thing on January 1. A simpleNote _p_-value calculation does not take this into account, so mathematically it appears less probable than it really is.

# Try it yourself

You can calculate the values on this page on your own! Try running the Python code to see the calculation results. Show the steps to do this.  
  

```
# These modules make it easier to perform the calculation
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# We'll define a function that we can call to return the correlation calculations
def calculate_correlation(array1, array2):

    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
    correlation, p_value = stats.pearsonr(array1, array2)

    # Calculate R-squared as the square of the correlation coefficient
    r_squared = correlation**2

    return correlation, r_squared, p_value

# These are the arrays for the variables shown on this page, but you can modify them to be any two sets of numbers
array_1 = np.array([11,12,3,4,14,6,4,3,35,14,14,6,8,10,11,22,])

array_1_name = "Super Bowl point difference"
array_2_name = "Highest sale price for a single-family home in Connecticut"

# Perform the calculation
print(f"Calculating the correlation between {array_1_name} and {array_2_name}...")
