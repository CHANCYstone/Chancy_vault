Alex Chohlas-Wood is an Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science. He received his Ph.D. in computational social science from Stanford University, an M.S. in applied urban science and informatics from NYU CUSP, and a B.A. in studio art from Carleton College. 

His research investigates whether computational approaches can improve public policy. In recent work, he designed an algorithm that uses AI to help prosecutors avoid implicit bias in charging decisions, tested whether automated behavioral nudges reduce incarceration for public defender clients, and developed a utility-maximizing framework for equitable algorithms. He is particularly interested in prototyping and evaluating scientific and technical innovations in applied collaborations with government agencies. 

Dr. Chohlas-Wood is a faculty co-director of the [Computational Policy Lab](http://comppolicylab.org/ "(opens in a new window)"), which he has led in various roles since 2018. Previously, he served as the director of analytics for the New York City Police Department. His efforts have been supported by Arnold Ventures, the Harvard Data Science Initiative, J-PAL North America, the MacArthur Foundation, the Microsoft Justice Reform Initiative, and Stanford Impact Labs. His research has directly informed state and local legislation and policymaking across the U.S.

# Marc Scott

## 

Co-Department Chair, Professor of Applied Statistics; Co-Director of PRIISM

### [Applied Statistics, Social Science, and Humanities](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/applied-statistics-social-science-and-humanities)

### [PRIISM](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/priism)

[marc.scott@nyu.edu](mailto:marc.scott@nyu.edu)

212-992-9407

Dr. Scott's research involves the development of statistical models for longitudinal data. Using latent variable approaches, he develops new classes of models for such data. He has used them to examine trends in wage inequality, with more recent applications including medical histories and psychological profiles. He also works on models for longitudinal sequence analysis. In the educational setting, such models examine the influence of the entire pathway (e.g., the timing of educational and employment spells and interruptions to these) on an outcome measure such as wages or degree completion. In work on low-wage labor markets, such models seek to find similar structure in the career histories and education of workers to identify more and less successful career ladders. More recent work involves multi-channel and model-based sequence analysis, sensitivity analysis for multilevel models and Bayesian computational methods.

Dr. Scott teaches Multi-Level Models: Growth Curves / Nested Data (APSTA-GE.2040/41/42), Practicum in Statistical Computing (APSTA-GE.2352), Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning (APSTA-GE.2011), and Spatial Statistics (APSTA-GE.2015). He serves as co-director with [Lisa Stulberg](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/ash/faculty_bios/view/Lisa_Stulberg) of the [Interdepartmental Research Studies](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/ash/interdepartmental) (IDRS) program. In Fall 2008, Steinhardt launched a new applied statistics center, PRIISM [(Center for Practice and Research at the Intersection of Information, Society, and Methodology)](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/priism/), for which he and [Jennifer Hill](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/ash/faculty_bios/view/Jennifer_L_Hill) served as co-directors. In 2014, Steinhardt launched a new [Masters of Science in Applied Statistics for Social Research](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/humsocsci/applied_statistics/) (MS-A3SR), for which he and Jennifer Hill served as co-directors.

In Fall 2020, Dr. Scott assumed the role of Chair, Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science, and Humanities. Prof. Jennifer Hill assumed the role of director of the PRIISM Center, and he became deputy director.

# HARVARD ADMISSION REQUIRED

- [Home](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/) 
- [Admissions & Aid](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/admissions-financial-aid) 
- [Doctoral Program Admissions](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/admissions-aid/doctoral-program-admissions) 
- [Admissions Requirements](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/admissions-aid/doctoral-program-admissions/admissions-requirements)

There are a few things you will need to know ahead of applying to the Public Policy (PPOL) PhD Program.

## Eligibility

You are eligible to apply to the PPOL PhD Program if you have earned a bachelor’s degree; a master's degree is not required. You apply and are admitted to one of four tracks:

- [Economics](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs/phd-public-policy/economics-track)
- [Judgment and Decision Making](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs/phd-public-policy/judgment-and-decision-making-track)
- [Politics and Institutions](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs/phd-public-policy/politics-and-institutions-track)
- [Science, Technology and Policy Studies](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/doctoral-programs/phd-public-policy/science-technology-and-policy-studies) 

You may not change tracks prior to matriculation.

### Requests to Change Tracks

If you are admitted to the PPOL PhD Program, you will matriculate into one of the four tracks. Ordinarily, you cannot change to a different track from the one to which you were admitted. In rare and exceptional circumstances, you can apply to change tracks by submitting a request to the PhD Program Chair, stating the reason for the proposed change, your background and qualifications for the proposed track, and how changing tracks may affect the time to completion of the PhD degree. The PhD Program Chair may request additional information, if necessary.

The PhD Program Chair will send the application and supporting documents (including your original application) to the Admissions subcommittee for the proposed track. The subcommittee will review the file and proposal, comparing the application for the proposed track with those of candidates who were admitted to the track. The subcommittee will then make a recommendation to the PhD Program Chair, who will make the final decision on the proposal.  
 

## Test Scores

### Graduate Record Examinations (GRE)

If you are applying for admission for fall 2025, you may submit GRE scores from tests taken no earlier than January 5, 2020. GRE scores are valid for no longer than five years.

MIT Sloan PhD Program graduates are leaders in their fields, conducting research with global impact on the complex organizational, financial, and technological issues that characterize an increasingly competitive and challenging business world.

PhD studies at MIT Sloan are intense and individual in nature, demanding a great deal of time, initiative, and discipline from every candidate. **But the rewards of such rigor are tremendous**: MIT Sloan PhD graduates go on to teach and conduct research at the world's most prestigious universities.

## What We Seek

The MIT Sloan PhD Program looks for a small number of people who will successfully complete our rigorous and demanding program and then thrive in academic research careers. The admission selection process is highly competitive; we aim for a class size of nineteen students, admitted from a pool of hundreds of applicants.

[Read about our admissions process and requirements](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/application-information)

## Program Structure

**Coursework**  
PhD students fulfill their coursework and methodology requirements by taking advantage of the more than 150 subjects offered at MIT Sloan — in addition to hundreds more offered across MIT. Students may also avail themselves of courses at other local universities. Course selection is made under the guidance of faculty in the student's research group.

**Master’s Thesis**  
In addition to taking elective classes, students in the second or third year of the program are expected to complete their first major research paper which will be a master’s thesis, earning them an SM in Management Research.

**General Examinations**  
The single most important hurdle in the PhD experience at MIT Sloan is the General Examinations. The exact form of these exams can vary according to the faculty and students involved, but they always involve written and oral parts given by the area faculty covering all of the relevant material.

**Dissertation**  
After students complete the General Examinations, the stage is set for them to begin work on a dissertation or thesis, the most unstructured and difficult part of doctoral studies. Students must choose a topic, define it to the satisfaction of a faculty committee, investigate it thoroughly (including gathering data at field sites), and write the dissertation.

Dissertations typically take one of two forms, either book-style chapters or separate essays. They are usually completed within two to three years of passing the General Examinations. The final step before achieving the doctorate is a public defense seminar, which is open to the entire MIT Sloan community.
