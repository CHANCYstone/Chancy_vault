第一部分：文章讲了什么？

Q1. 什么是组织创新？
We define organizationai creativity as the creation of a valuable, useful new product, service,idea, procedure, or process by individuals working together in a complex social system。

组织创造力创造力是在一个复杂的社会中创造有价值的、有用的新产品、服务、想法、通过个体共同工作的程序或过程 系统。因此，创造性的定义是行为，或将其置于组织环境中。这种行为的产物(例如，Arieti, 1976;巴伦,1969; Golann(1963)，

Q2.理论是怎么样构建的？
The starting point for our theoretical development is provided by the interactionist model of creative behavior developed by Woodman and Schoenfeldt (1989).

interactionist model of creative behavior

为组织创新理论构建一个相互作用的框架

This interactionist model provides an integrating framework that combines important elements of the personality (e.g.. Woodman, 1981), cognitive (e.g., Hayes, 1989), and social psychology (e.g., Amabile, 1983) explanations of creativity

 Within the person, both cognitive(knowledge, cognitive skills, and cognitive styles/preferences) and noncognitive (e.g., personality) aspects of the mind are related to creativebehavior.
  In sum, individual creativity is a function of 
  
  1. antecedent conditions (e.g., past reinforcement history, biographical variables), 
  2. cognitive style and ability (e.g., divergent thinking, ideational fluency), personalityfactors (e.g., self-esteem, locus of control),  
  3. relevant knowledge, 
  4. motivation, 
  5. social influences (e.g., social facilitation, social rewards), 
  6. and contextual influences (e.g., physical environment, 
  task and time constraint

有点碎且比较杂

利用交互式模型来组织聚焦于以下几个方面的关于创造力的文献：
 (a) individual creativity
 (b) group creativity
 (c) organizational creativity.

关于个人层面的创新的相关因素

Antecedent Conditions：
 Results sugested specific sets of biographical variables that had differential associations with creative achievement depending on the area ofachievement
Personality Factors：
 核心的人格特性包括：
 high valuation of esthetic qualities in experience, broad interests, attraction to complexity, high energy, independence of judgment, autonomy, intuition, self-confidence, ability to resolve antinomies or to accommodate apparently opposite or conflicting traits in one's self-concept, and a firm sense of self as creative"
 
Cognitive Factors：
1. 只有发散式思维和聚合式思维相结合才可以产生创造力
2. 创造力是社会一部分人们获得知识的一般过程

Intrinsic Motivation：
内在动机的只要功能是对注意力的控制


关于group层面的创新的相关影响因素：

Conditions for Group Creativity：

To briefly summarize, the probability of creative outcomes may be highest when leadership is democratic and collaborative, structure is organic rather than mechanistic, and groups are composed of
individuals drawn from diverse fields or functional backgrounds. Group
cohesiveness and longevity represent group characteristics whose relationship to creativity, though seemingly important, is problematic.
一般认为多元化的，民主的，合作的组织更加有创造力

Group Process and Problem Solving：
Group problem-solving techniques, such as brainstorming, were developed with the belief that rules or norms that restrain evaluation of ideas being generated would allow members to build off of others' ideas and would result in a greater number of novel ideas being generated.

Social Information：
Social information consists of verbal and nonverbal cues and signals that people provide to others regarding what factors they value in the workplace and how they evaluate those factors in their current situations

团体层面的创新并非是每个人的创造力的加和，团体或者说集体的创造力由 团体的构成，团体的特征，以及团体的过程处理等因素所影响，




组织层面的创新的相关影响因素：
Creativity Training：

当前对于组织上的创造力相关的训练还是比较狭隘，必须要拓宽训练的目标，来理解影响创造力的前置条件。

Conditions for Organizational Creativity：

 More recently, Cohen and Levinthal (1990) posited that the ability of an organization to recognize and use external information is crucial for
innovation. This ability, which Cohen and Levinthal labeled absorptive
capacity, may be related to a variety of innovation activities, including
investment in R&D, the conduct of basic research (thus providing a link to
creativity), and the adoption and diffusion of innovation.

如何实现创造，外部环境也很重要，从外部环境中获取信息很重要

We postulate that organizational characteristics create the contextual influences that operate on both individuals and groups to influence
their creativity. Organizational creativity (the creative outcomes of a complex social system) is then a function of group creativity and contextual influences, including those which come from the environment (see Equation Co in Figure 1).
