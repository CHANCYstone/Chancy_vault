## Abstract

_In this article, I outline the reasons why the choice of PhD research topic has important and persistent effects on an economist_'_s career. Although the issues raised in this article are most acute for those wishing to pursue a career in academia, there are also implications for those working outside academia. While there are many factors that determine whether an economist has a successful career, I argue that the choice of PhD topic is an issue, which deserves more attention. Although primarily targeted at PhD students, the issues raised here resonate throughout an economist_'_s career_.

## 1 Introduction

There is a handful of excellent guides to different aspects of the academic profession that are invaluable to PhD students in economics.[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0002_1 "Link to note") These guides cover issues including, but not limited to: selecting a graduate school or university (Mankiw [2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0017); Meager [2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0018)); starting (PhD) research (Creedy [2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0005); Davis [2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0008); Pischke [2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0019)); professional etiquette (Hamermesh [1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0013)); getting a PhD _and_ saving the world (Blattman [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0002)); completing a tear-free PhD (Creedy [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0007)); work routines (Dixit [1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0009)); job market advice (Cawley [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0004); Blattman [2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0003); Frijters [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0010)); and publishing your work (Creedy [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0006)).[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0003_15 "Link to note") As a complement to these guides, I want to focus this article on one specific (and often under-appreciated) choice that a young researcher makes: the choice of the PhD topic. Most students considering embarking on a PhD focus on more immediate choices, such as the institution and the choice of PhD supervisor, rather than the choice of topic. All three choices, however, have persistent long-term effects on your career—and I argue that there is no good reason to under-estimate the importance of the choice of the PhD topic.

Many of the student guides mentioned above cover issues associated with how to choose a PhD topic. Particularly noteworthy is Davis ([2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0008)), who sagely quipped that: ‘… there is no “right topic”. What is hot today may be ice cold by the time you go on the job market. You don't want to be the nineteenth best paper of the year on a hot topic’. Davis's point cuts to the chase: it is wrong-headed (and perhaps impossible) to try and strategically choose your PhD topic. I say ‘wrong-headed’ because you should focus your research on something you feel passionate about, not what is fashionable at the time. Also, I say ‘impossible’ because no one can predict with any accuracy the meandering course that the academic literature will follow, nor how many other PhD students will choose the same topic as you. So, it is not possible to know (without a serious amount of effort) the supply of PhD students working on Topic A who are going to be on the job market in Year X. My advice would be: do not invest too much time thinking about this; you already have enough on your plate.

Where this article differs from the others is that I have attempted to provide more concrete guidance on what constitutes a good research topic _and_ to spell out in more detail why the choice of research topic matters. Hopefully, there is a kernel of something useful in these observations. Specifically, I argue that the choice of topic will: (partly) determine how quickly you are able to complete your PhD; influence the type and quality of job opportunities you face after your PhD is completed; shape your future research trajectory; and be an important component of your academic reputation. For those interested in pursuing a research career in academia after your PhD, you should care about all of these factors. For those interested in other career options, such as government, international agencies, consulting firms or central banks, at least the first two will be of interest.

In the rest of this article, these issues are explained in more detail. To be clear, it is not my intention to argue that this is _more important_ than choice of university or supervisor, just that it is often not appreciated just how important the ability to choose a ‘good’ research topic is until after the fact. In other words, people systematically under-value this skill. Perhaps, part of the reason for this is that people do not recognise that the choice of PhD topic is not really a one-off—although you only choose your PhD topic once (with the obvious exception of those who abandon their original choice for one reason or another), the lessons learnt here have lots of useful future applications. For academics, this skill is applied to the ongoing set of research topic choices made throughout your career, while for the non-academic economist, there are similar long-term benefits associated with being able to clearly frame (and motivate) the project you are working on. In my experience, this skill is scarce and valuable.

Note that there are two levels to the discussion above: the ‘research topic’ (for example, government outsourcing) and the more specific ‘research question’ (for example, does outsourcing save money?). To simplify matters, when I refer to the ‘PhD research topic’, I literally mean the set of research questions that underpins the PhD dissertation. For academics, the ability to select good research questions has important consequences for the likelihood of getting published _and_ the impact of your work once published. Fortunately, it is something that you can improve over time with practice.

## 2 Undertaking a PhD

Doing a PhD is one of the most challenging things most people will ever do in their professional life. Nothing quite compares to the anguish created during the process of satisfactorily fulfilling the requirements of a doctoral dissertation. From a naïve starting point, it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that a PhD is simply ‘a much bigger essay than the one I did in third year’. It is not: it is profoundly different and much more difficult.[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0004_17 "Link to note") As explained to me very early on in my PhD candidature: ‘It is as much a test of perseverance as it is of intelligence’. On reflection, this seems about right: there are many smart people who drop out and just as many competent-but-not-exceptional people who make it to the end as a result of their doggedness. However, it can also be a very enjoyable process: you have an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to read widely (and deeply) and to sample the joys of understanding, assimilating, and communicating knowledge.

For those who choose a career in academia, the rewards are simple: a high degree of autonomy (who to work with, when to work, what to work on) that is uncommon in other work environments; an opportunity to spend your life continuing to satisfy your intellectual curiosity; educating the next generation of business people, consultants and policy-makers; and a unique ability to travel the world and engage (passively or actively) with some smart and interesting people. For those choosing to work as economists outside of academia, a PhD provides a unique set of skills which will enable you (unlike most of your peers) to: be able to understand academic scholarship; provide you with rare technical skills; and ground you in thinking about problems from first principles. Depending on the context, a PhD might also enable you to command a salary premium, although people do not typically enter academia because of the salaries.[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0005_18 "Link to note")

It is worth reminding the reader that these rewards do not just appear like magic once the PhD graduation ceremony is finished. Rather, the PhD is just a stepping stone to the next stage of your career: once you have earned the right to call yourself ‘Dr’, you have to work hard to develop your career. For academics, the first 5 years after the completion of your PhD are crucial: although substantial ‘sorting’ occurs during the PhD—the weaker students drop out and the strong survive—as much ‘sorting’ occurs in the 5 years immediately after the PhD. Most of the subsidies that are available to early career academics—in the form of lighter teaching loads, research seed funds and early career research grants—are provided with a view to helping junior academics to undertake research in the hope that they will go on to publish in top journals and win competitive research grants. But, the reality of the situation is that only a small proportion of the newly minted PhDs will actively (and continually) publish in the leading journals. Rightly or wrongly, it is to these individuals that most of the spoils of academia—the international conference invitations and speedy promotion through the academic ranks—will be bestowed. So, you have to get some serious runs on the board in that first 5 years after the PhD if you are to be a serious contender to be on the ‘research track’ in your academic career. Once the subsidies dry up, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to re-establish yourself as a serious researcher.

## 3 Reasons Why the PhD Topic Choice Is Important

PhDs come in all shapes and sizes: some are book-like, while others are essays-on-a-related-theme; some are pure theory, while others are purely empirical. There are many factors that will affect the likelihood (and speed) of PhD completion[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0006_19 "Link to note"): student-specific factors (for example, intelligence, perseverance); university-specific factors (for example, support for PhD students, size and quality of PhD student cohort); supervisor-specific factors (for example, ability, commitment to students, interest in your topic); and the choice of research topic (for example, novelty, importance, tractability). In this article, I assume away the first three factors and focus purely on the choice of PhD topic.

Before discussing the reasons to choose your PhD topic wisely, I briefly digress to discuss the supervisor's role in the decision. My main objective is to consider those instances where the student plays a major role in choosing the PhD topic. However, there are many instances where the PhD topic is chosen by the PhD supervisor; for example, if the PhD supervisor has received a grant from a research funding agency that nominated funds for a PhD student _to work on a specific project_. Even in these instances, the PhD student should not be complacent: it is your responsibility to work hard to develop _your own research questions_ and to read the literature carefully (and widely) to inform the currency of your approach.[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0007_20 "Link to note") Regardless of who chooses the topic, the student should play an active role in outlining the specific research questions.

A useful framework to apply to the choice of PhD topic is ‘search theory’: students trawl through the set of available potential topics (with incomplete information) until they find one that satisfies their preferences.[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0008_21 "Link to note") Delaying the choice is costly since the longer the time taken, the further behind the student lags. But, making a hasty decision can end up having painful consequences in the long term. So, there is an optimal point at which the student trades off the costs and benefits and decides to start on a particular research topic. Given this, it is important to keep asking yourself the question: Is this topic good enough (relative to the other alternatives) to stop the search process? It is also worth bearing in mind that one way to manage the risk that your ‘chosen project’ will fail is to adopt a portfolio approach: have a few contingency topics in mind at any point in time should your preferred project fail (which is not altogether uncommon and often completely outside of your control; for example, if you are collecting primary field data, you necessarily rely on others' approval to compile the data, which can be withdrawn in a flash).

The first reason why choice of PhD topic matters is that PhD students asking ‘good’ research questions—the characteristics of which are explained below—will finish faster than others, all other things being equal. Many PhD students start off with grandiose questions that are impossible to answer in a 3-year period. What is commonly misunderstood is that doing a PhD is not about answering the world's big questions. It is much more about demonstrating that you have the necessary skills to do independent research. This includes demonstrating that you have command over a wide range of current (and emerging) research techniques (which is highly valued by employers), but it also includes demonstrating a deep understanding of all aspects of the research production process. Once you realise this, it will be clear that asking a ‘good’ research question enables you to showcase these skills: to articulate the problem clearly, to explain why it is interesting or important, to utilise appropriate tools and techniques to answer the question and to draw sound conclusions. The ability to articulate a research question that is both interesting and tractable will hold you in good stead for the rest of your career. So, it is worth practising this as soon as possible.

There is also good reason to argue that your PhD topic will influence your future job opportunities, research trajectory and reputation. Once you finish your PhD and enter the job market, a complex matching process occurs: universities will be looking to strengthen in certain areas of the discipline where they are weak (or where they see a latent demand) and PhD students will be looking to rank their preferred institutions based on their location, quality, teaching load and salary. Where you end up getting a job will be the result of this matching process. Given this, your opportunities will be partly determined by the subject matter of your PhD.

Although it is not perfect, a good heuristic to use is to choose a topic that you feel passionate about.[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0009_22 "Link to note") Many students will feel some antipathy towards their chosen topic at some stage of the PhD process (that is fairly natural), so it is important to choose a topic that does not fill you with dread. Although it is difficult to predict what discipline areas a university will be looking to fill in 3–5 years' time, there is a much higher probability that they will be looking to fill in a position in a mainstream area of economics than in an obscure area. Although what will be ‘mainstream’ in the future is largely unknown—and this does evolve over time as the emergence of fields like behavioural economics in recent years has shown—there are definite risks in choosing a topic that is new and emerging. That is not to say that these risks are not worth taking, just that one should be aware of them.

## 4 Characteristics of ‘Good’ Research Questions

So far, the importance of good research questions has been emphasised with only a passing mention of their characteristics. Although it is impossible to give a definitive set of characteristics, there are some guiding principles that should inform the young scholar about what constitutes a ‘good’ research question. Barrett ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0001)) suggests that: ‘Especially for empirical work, choose topics where the result is interesting _no matter what answer you get_’. His argument is that this minimises the risks of: (i) a zero return (that is, you do not get the answer you expected) and (ii) torturing the data (that is, running regressions until you get the answer you expected). This guiding principle is another useful heuristic to use when thinking about your question. But, it is also handy to have a more grounded set of guidelines—not a checklist per se,[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0010_24 "Link to note") but a summary of the key issues to consider when choosing research topics.

The ideas proposed here are perhaps not perfectly generaliseable to all contexts: the lens through which my experience is coloured is empirical economics, so I have much less feel for what is a ‘good’ research question in theoretical economics (although there is likely to be considerable overlap). There are three main principles that constitute an interesting question—it must be _novel_, _important_ and _tractable_. The very best research questions—which often lead to the very best research publications—fall in the intersection of these three domains.[10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0011_25 "Link to note") It is important to revisit these principles frequently in order to drum them into your mind.

What are novelty, importance and tractability? ‘Novelty’ essentially relates to the notion that your work must push back the frontier of knowledge. It must create something that is new (to the world, not just new to your own country). This is probably much harder to do in some domains than others; for example, older (more mature) areas of enquiry that have been studied intensively by the brightest and best for the last 50 years are likely to pose a much tougher novelty requirement than newer areas of enquiry.[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0012_26 "Link to note") There are obvious risk–reward tradeoffs embedded in the novelty of your topic: the size of the ‘inventive step’[12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0013_27 "Link to note") of your research topic is hard to gauge, but it seems uncontroversial to state that those with a smaller inventive step will have less of an impact on the profession than those with a high inventive step, ceteris paribus.[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0014_28 "Link to note") But, with the potential of higher impact comes the fact that completion rates will fall and completion duration will increase.

‘Importance’ refers to the idea that the answer to your question must be of interest (and relevance) to the profession or for the welfare of society. For the most part, economics is not an abstract, esoteric social science (at least it is not for empirical economists and applied theorists): it is practical and relevant. So, you need to be able to articulate the relevance—it is not sufficient to simply show a relationship between X and Y without explaining why understanding this relationship is important for societal welfare. Although this point about ‘importance’ is seemingly obvious, it turns out to be much harder than expected to articulate _why_ something is important. In fact, it is something that you are likely to have to continually work at over your career. So, do not be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this idea: it can be really tough to answer the question ‘Why should anyone care about the answer to this question?’

Finally, ‘tractability’ refers to the ability to answer the question posed. There is no point at all asking a profound question if it cannot be answered using available techniques or data (of course, you could create the new technique and/or data to answer the profound question, but it is probably too much to do both in one PhD thesis). All too often, PhD students fall into the trap of asking questions that just cannot be answered (or, as Creedy [2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0007) points out, questions that might take a lifetime of research to answer): it is much better to ask a small, focused question and to answer this comprehensively, including a thorough exploration of all of the possible alternative explanations for your finding. The inherent conflict between novelty and tractability will need to be handled carefully. Remember that the PhD is actually just a licence to do future research: it is the ticket required to demonstrate that you are a bona fide member of the academy. So, it might be wise to think about tackling novelty on only one dimension of your topic (that is, theory or data or method) in order not to jeopardise tractability.

One of the hardest and most important lessons for an academic to learn is how to separate a ‘good’ research question from one that is ‘not quite as good’.[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0015_30 "Link to note") If you are going to be successful, you need to be able to rank-order your ideas so that you allocate your scarce time efficiently. You need to apply basic economic principles to your own research endeavours! This means that you need to learn not to over-invest in weak ideas (or papers) because they will just soak up all your energy and time. The question is: How do you know when to let a paper go? Unfortunately, this is hard to know, especially when you are just starting out. But over time, you get better at knowing when to persist with a paper (even when it has been rejected several times) and when to let a paper go. To be clear, having a paper rejected many times is _not_ a perfect indicator of a low-quality research idea: the refereeing process is noisy and plenty of good papers are rejected many times before eventually being published and having a major impact on the profession.[15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0016_31 "Link to note") But, sometimes it is important to drop a paper that is going nowhere. Whether (and when) to do this is difficult, but essential.[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0017_32 "Link to note")

Once you have picked your research topic and done the research, the next big challenge is how to write the paper. This in itself is a huge and important task; one that is worthy of a separate article.[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-note-0018_33 "Link to note") Suffice to say that a good research question does not automatically end up as a good research article: it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. I typically find that papers need to be rewritten several times before they are suitable for publication. No doubt my writing has improved over time, but it is still the case that challenging papers require several rewrites before I feel confident in the logic, content and flow of the piece. Given that a major rewrite can take a week (sometimes much longer), it can create some anxious moments when you have to leave the desk (to eat, sleep, exercise, socialise) knowing that your paper is still in bits and pieces on the shop floor. Without a manual to help you rebuild the paper (unlike a mechanic), you have to have confidence in your ability to tackle whatever problems reveal themselves. Learning to accept that this ‘dismantling’ (and the anxious feelings it creates) is part of the process of rewriting papers is an important breakthrough.

## 5 Some Final Comments

One of the main lessons to heed from this article is that academia is full of very bright people who have not achieved their potential—or have not left a legacy—in terms of their research. The question is: Why? The obvious answer is that research is really hard: it takes a lot of time with the door closed to avoid interruptions and a lot of deep thinking over an extended period of time to produce a body of work that might influence current policy decisions or future scholarly work. Also, it takes a very thick skin: you will undoubtedly have your papers rejected time and time again by (at times) seemingly clueless referees and editors. It is incredibly frustrating to have to go back to the drawing board to sort out which comments are worth taking on board and which comments are nonsense. It is commonplace to over-estimate the number that fall into the latter category and under-estimate the number in the former category. But, once again, this is something that improves with time (and perhaps age).

For those interested in pursuing a research career, remember that there is only a finite number of suitable journal outlets for each paper (and only a finite number of slots in each journal), so you need to think carefully before aimlessly sending out a freshly rejected paper to another journal (and perhaps waiting a year to receive a referee's report). This may necessitate taking a serious look at the paper and deciding whether it is worth undertaking a major revision or simply dropping the paper (and perhaps revisiting in a year or two). Given the psychological distress that this process can cause to some people, it should not be surprising that not everyone is well suited to the research endeavour. Many good academics have tired of conducting research—and the vagaries of the publishing process—and have chosen to focus on other aspects of their career.

Hopefully, the overview I have provided here will be enlightening for PhD students (and young researchers) who are embarking on a research career path. It is certainly not an easy path to choose, but it can be extremely rewarding. The key message to take home is that choosing your PhD topic carefully is important for short-term reasons, but also for long-term reasons because it will shape so much of your future. I would like to end with some final tips on issues relating to the choice of your research topic:

- Be bold: it is often easy to jump on a bandwagon and attempt to investigate a well-explored subject using existing datasets. However, the danger is that these have often been cherry-picked by some of the world's best scholars. This can make life very difficult in terms of satisfying the ‘novelty’ component of your thesis.
- Be creative: one of the most neglected ways of doing good research is to seek out interesting data. ‘Good’ research questions can be much easier to ask if you have a dataset with a novel element that has not yet been exploited. Although these are hard to come by (particularly when you are a humble PhD student), they are out there. Also, do not be afraid to build your own data (or link two existing datasets) in order to pose ‘good’ questions. Some risks are worth taking.
- Be focused: avoid the temptation to ask questions like ‘Why is Africa still poor?’ since they are simply too complex to answer in one economics PhD dissertation. Ask a smaller, focused question and answer it thoroughly. Also, do not be afraid to continually refine your question over time. You can be sure that you will not get it right the first time and that it will need to be honed over time.
- Be active: although it is important to spend plenty of time on your own research, make sure that you are active within your department. Attend the seminars (even present yourself), organise your fellow students into a reading group and do not be afraid to ask others for assistance as most are surprisingly willing to be of assistance where possible.
- Be careful: everything you do sends a signal to others about your quality. Even simple things like emails are signals of how much care you take with your work: if they are error-strewn, people cannot help but wonder ‘What if this person is as careless with their STATA code as they are with their emails?’ So, be thorough and careful in everything you do.

## Endnotes

- 1 However, they are also valuable to older, more established academics since they contain insights that are worthy of contemplation for scholars at (just about) every stage of their career.
- 2 For a fairly comprehensive list of these guides, see Kudamatsu ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0016)).
- 3 There is a small minority of PhD students who cruise through the whole thing relatively unflustered. Also, there are a small number of institutions that seemingly ‘give away’ low-quality PhDs. But for the majority of people in the majority of institutions, the PhD is a very difficult undertaking.
- 4 There are those who do earn large salaries in academia, but these are mostly reserved for those who are ‘research stars’, go into a senior administrative position within a university, teach in executive education programs in a business school, or provide consulting services to government or business.
- 5 This list is not exhaustive: it is meant purely as a guide to the type of factors that are important.
- 6 When Chicago University's Richard Thaler was asked about his advice for young researchers just starting out, he stated: ‘Work on your own ideas, not your advisor's ideas (or at least in addition to her ideas)’ (see Halonen [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0012)).
- 7 Thanks to an anonymous referee for suggesting this idea. The original contribution to search theory dates back to Stigler ([1961](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0020)).
- 8 A complementary view is provided by Dixit ([1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0009), p. 73), who stated: ‘Don't give too much weight to the social importance of the issue; instead do what captures your intellectual interest and creative imagination … mere relevance of an issue will not guarantee good research unless you have a drive to work on it!’ In Dixit's view, the key determinant of whether you are passionate about a topic is whether or not you find working on the topic fun.
- 9 However, checklists can also be very useful. For example, Barrett's ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0001)) checklist proposes that good research questions resolve a puzzle, explode a myth, expound a new theory etc.
- 10 As an interesting aside, there is evidence emerging that the age at which great invention occurs is steadily increasing. For example, Jones ([2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0015)) shows that the age at which the research that led to Nobel prizes (and landmark inventions) was created has increased over the last century. Innovation in science and technology, it seems, is getting harder and being increasingly conducted in larger teams with highly specialised skills (also see Jones [2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0014)). The myth of the lone, young, brilliant polymath making breakthrough achievements is just that.
- 11 That is not meant to be a call to arms for students to seek out less mature areas of enquiry in order to find an easier route to demonstrating novelty. It is merely my _contention_ that it is probably harder to push the frontiers in labour economics, than say, health economics because of the different level of maturity of the two research domains. Of course, I could be wrong about this.
- 12 I am borrowing this term from the patent literature. The ‘inventive step’ is the requirement that an invention must not only be novel, it must be unobvious, in order to be granted a patent. If the inventive step is too small (which is a subjective decision made by patent examiners skilled in the art of the invention), the invention will not be granted a patent.
- 13 Richard Thaler had some interesting thoughts when it came to this issue. He stated: ‘… spend more time thinking and less time reading. Too much reading leads people to think of small variations on existing studies’ (see Halonen [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0012)).
- 14 Hopefully, you are able to identify ‘bad’ research questions straight away and drop them from your workstream. But, this is not always the case.
- 15 In fact, there are some economists who have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for papers, which were rejected many times before being accepted (see Gans and Shepherd [1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0011)).
- 16 When Richard Thaler was asked about the worst research project he ever worked on, he responded: ‘There is nothing in print that I would want to take back. I have abandoned lots of projects. I believe in ignoring sunk costs. As I tell my MBA students: “Ignore sunk costs. Assume everyone else doesn't”’ (see Halonen [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8462.12038#aere12038-bib-0012)). This is good advice: it is important to bear in mind that simple economics dictates that abandoning a project is often the rational thing to do and that even the best in the profession do it.
- 17 Paul Frijters recently mentioned in a presentation at the University of Melbourne that writing is the scarcest and most valuable of all the skills required to publish well. Good writing is essential to motivate and market your ideas.
