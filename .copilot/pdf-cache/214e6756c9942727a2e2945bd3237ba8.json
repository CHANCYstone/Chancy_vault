While stock prices, market capitalization, \n\nand corporate profits have all increased markedly, the la-\n\nbor share of income and the rate of economic growth have \n\ndeclined (Barkai, 2020; Greenwald et al., 2021; Karabar-\n\nbounis and Neiman, 2013 ). Without long-run cross-country \n\ndata, however, one cannot tell whether these develop-\n\nments are a recent country-specific phenomenon, or are \n\npart of a broader secular trend. After all, Rajan and Zin-\n\ngales (2003) have shown that stock market cycles can be \n\nvery long, with the 1990s increases in market capitaliza-\n\ntion being a reversal to the previously high levels of the \n\nearly 1900s. Similarly, the recent labor share declines may \n\nbe specific to the US (Gutiérrez and Piton, 2020 ), and in-\n\ncreases in corporate profitability may represent mean re-\n\nversals following profit declines of the 1960s and 1970s \n\n(Barkai and Benzell, 2018; Feldstein and Summers, 1977; \n\nNordhaus, 1974 ). \n\nThis paper studies long-run trends in listed firms’ mar-\n\nket capitalization and their drivers. The unique advantage \n\nof focusing on listed companies is that we can obtain the \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.09.008 \n\n0304-405X/© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552 \n\nhigh-quality data necessary for analyzing corporate sec-\n\ntor developments over very long time periods in many \n\ncountries. For this purpose, we introduce a new integrated \n\ndatabase covering stock market capitalization, equity is-\n\nsuance, stock prices, and listed firms’ dividends and earn-\n\nings in 17 advanced economies from 1870 to 2016. 1 These \n\nseries were constructed from a wide range of primary \n\nand secondary historical sources, with many of these pre-\n\nviously unused or newly assembled using hand-collected \n\narchival data. Together with the extensive documentation \n\nin the online Data Appendix, they provide a new resource \n\nfor researchers to study the development of the stock mar-\n\nket, corporate profitability, and equity finance throughout \n\nthe last century and a half. The detail of our data also al-\n\nlows us to not only document the trends, but also to per-\n\nform a detailed accounting decomposition of the drivers of \n\nlong-run stock market growth. \n\nWe find that between 1870 and the 1980s, advanced \n\neconomy stock market capitalization grew in line with \n\nGDP, averaging to around one-third of output. Through-\n\nout this period, long-run stock market growth was driven \n\nby equity issuances while real capital gains were on av-\n\nerage zero. After the 1980s, a sharp structural break took \n\nplace with market cap to GDP ratios across advanced \n\neconomies tripling and remaining persistently high. In con-\n\ntrast to the historical period, this recent growth acceler-\n\nation was driven by rising stock prices while issuances \n\nactually slowed. The key driver behind these stock price \n\nincreases was a profit shift away from other parts of \n\nthe economy towards listed corporations, with listed firm \n\nprofit growth far outstripping that in GDP and capital in-\n\ncome. Our findings show that the post-1980s increases in \n\nUS corporate profits and market capitalization are part of \n\nan unprecedented global expansion, which goes above and \n\nbeyond the well-documented increases in advanced econ-\n\nomy capital shares. \n\nOur findings speak to three pertinent issues in fi-\n\nnancial economics. The first of these concerns the long-\n\nrun evolution of stock market size. Effort s to document \n\nthe size of the listed equity market date back to at \n\nleast to the 19th century, first conducted through sur-\n\nveys commissioned by wealthy financiers (Burdett, 1882; \n\nGreen, 1887 ) and later through increasingly systematic ef-\n\nforts to map out the trends in different components of \n\nhousehold wealth (Hoffmann, 1965; Roe, 1971; Goldsmith, \n\n1985 ). The received wisdom is that both the stock market \n\n(Rajan and Zingales, 2003 ) and total wealth (Piketty and \n\nZucman, 2014 ) were large in the early and late 20th cen-\n\ntury, and depressed in-between. We show that this is in-\n\ndeed the case, but the historical and the current stock \n\nmarket expansion are more different than they are alike, \n\nwith the recent expansion being larger, more persistent, \n\nand driven by different forces. \n\nThe second issue concerns the drivers of long-run stock \n\nmarket growth. Two literatures have addressed this ques-\n\ntion from different angles with the first focusing on the                                         \n\n> 1The market capitalization and issuance data are newly assembled, and\n> the stock price and dividend data are updated versions of those in Jordà et al. (2019) .Earnings data only cover the recent decades, whereas all\n> other series cover along-run cross-section of countries.\n\nrole of institutions and norms in facilitating household sav-\n\nings and market entry (La Porta et al., 1997; Piketty and \n\nZucman, 2014; Rajan and Zingales, 2003 ), and the second \n\nfocusing on growth in profits and stock prices through in-\n\ncreases in mark-ups (Corhay et al., 2020; De Loecker et al., \n\n2020 ), declines in taxes (McGrattan and Prescott, 2005 ), \n\nand falls in the labor share (Greenwald et al., 2021 ). We \n\nshow that the degree to which each of these views is ap-\n\nplicable depends very much on context and the histori-\n\ncal period studied. While norms, institutions, and issuances \n\nare likely to have been key throughout history, the recent \n\nperiod is very unusual in that most of the stock market \n\ngrowth was driven by rising equity prices, fueled by high \n\nlisted firm profits which reflected a redistribution of in-\n\ncome within capital. \n\nThe third issue relates to the scope and scale of the ob-\n\nserved trends. Prior studies document a number of sec-\n\nular trends for US corporations with some debate on \n\ntheir pervasiveness across countries and economic sectors: \n\nincreases in corporate profits and concentration (Barkai, \n\n2020; Philippon, 2019; De Loecker et al., 2020 ), falls in \n\ncorporate issuance (or rising corporate savings; Gao et al., \n\n2013; Doidge et al., 2013; Armenter and Hnatkovska, 2017; \n\nChen et al., 2017 ), and a rise and fall of the value added \n\nshare of corporations (Jensen, 1989; Saez and Zucman, \n\n2020; Smith et al., 2019 ). We show that the scope of \n\nthe trends in both capitalization and listed profits is very \n\nbroad, spanning the major advanced economies and eco-\n\nnomic sectors, and that their scale is historically unprece-\n\ndented. The slowdown in corporate net equity issuance \n\nalso extends beyond the US economy. That being said, \n\nthe post-1980s trends do show some differences between \n\ncountries with, for example, high equity issuances in Por-\n\ntugal, modest capitalization growth in the UK and Italy, \n\nand relatively strong stock market growth in Sweden and \n\nSwitzerland. But the US is by no means an outlier, rank-\n\ning around the middle of advanced economies in terms of \n\nthe magnitudes of the decline in issuances and increases \n\nin profits and capitalization. \n\nOur detailed analysis starts by documenting long-run \n\ncross-country trends in stock market wealth. The first cen-\n\ntury of our data saw several pronounced cycles, with the \n\nmedian market cap to GDP ratio doubling between the \n\nearly 1890s and 1910, falling back to its 1880s levels af-\n\nter World War I, increasing again in the 1950s and falling \n\nto near-historical lows after the 1970s stagflation. But all \n\nthese cycles were largely mean-reverting: median stock \n\nmarket capitalization always eventually returned to its \n\nlong-run level of around one-third of GDP, and the cross-\n\ncountry interquartile range stayed between 0.1 and 0.6 of \n\nGDP. \n\nOver the last several decades, an unprecedented expan-\n\nsion saw the cross-country median market cap to GDP ra-\n\ntio increase from 0.2 in 1980 to 1 in 20 0 0. Moreover, this \n\nsurge in stock market wealth seems to have been persis-\n\ntent. Despite sharp equity price corrections in the early \n\n20 0 0s and 20 08–20 09, market cap to GDP ratios today re-\n\nmain around three times larger than the historical norm. \n\nThese “big bang” increases in market capitalization took \n\nplace in all 17 countries, and in each country bar one (Bel-\n\ngium), they represented the largest structural break in the            \n\n> 528 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n\nmarket cap to GDP ratio during the entire 146-year his-\n\ntorical time period examined here. The observed long-run \n\ntrends also underscore a rise in the global importance of \n\nthe US equity market at the expense of the UK and France: \n\nwhile all three countries enjoyed roughly equal global mar-\n\nket shares in the early 1900s, by the 1960s the US stock \n\nmarket accounted for close to 70% of the total 17-country \n\ncapitalization. \n\nMarket capitalization growth can be driven by either \n\nquantities (i.e., equity issuances) or prices. We find that \n\nthroughout the majority of the historical period, long-run \n\ncapitalization growth was primarily quantity driven. Before \n\n1985, real market capitalization grew by about 4% per year \n\nwith the lion share of this growth accounted for by net \n\nequity issuance. Examining its drivers, we find that net is-\n\nsuance was higher when new markets were being estab-\n\nlished, and when the cost of equity was low relative to the \n\ncost of debt. While stock prices were volatile both over the \n\nshort and medium run, before 1985 these cyclical fluctua-\n\ntions averaged out to around zero. \n\nIn contrast to these historical episodes, the post-1980s \n\nacceleration in stock market growth was accompanied by \n\na slowdown in net equity issuance, which was more than \n\ncompensated for by sharp increases in real capital gains. \n\nWe run two counterfactual exercises, which confirm the \n\nimportance of stock prices in driving the post-1985 in-\n\ncreases in market capitalization. If we ignore the post-1985 \n\nchanges in issuances by setting issuance levels to their pre-\n\n1985 average, the counterfactual evolution of stock market \n\ncap closely follows actual data up to 20 0 0 and results in \n\neven larger capitalization increases afterwards. If we ignore \n\nthe changes in prices by setting post-1985 capital gains to \n\ntheir historical average of around zero, the market cap to \n\nGDP ratio actually declines due to slowing issuance. In the \n\ncross-section, countries with the highest post-1985 capi-\n\ntal gains also recorded the largest market capitalization in-\n\ncreases during this time period. \n\nBut the fact that net issuance slowed and capital gains \n\nincreased does not mean that all these capital gains ac-\n\ncrued to firms already listed in the 1980s. On the con-\n\ntrary, we show that the slowdown in net issuance hides \n\nlarge gross movements between old and new listings, with \n\nthe newly listed firm share generally increasing after 1980. \n\nOver the very long run, new listings follow a U-shaped pat-\n\ntern with large new listing waves in the early 1900s, very \n\nfew new listings in the mid 20th century, and a revival \n\nof new listings, especially in previously tightly regulated \n\neconomies, during the 1980s and 1990s. This lends support \n\nto the Rajan and Zingales’ (2003) “great reversals” theory \n\nthat links the mid-20th century stagnation in financial de-\n\nvelopment to an increasing dominance of market incum-\n\nbents at the expense of new firms. \n\nTo map out the deeper underlying drivers of the post-\n\n1980s increases in stock prices and capitalization, we use \n\nthe dynamic Gordon growth model to decompose the mar-\n\nket cap to GDP ratio into three components: the current \n\nratio of listed firms’ dividends to GDP (the profit share \n\nchannel), future growth of dividends or earnings, and the \n\nrate at which these future cashflows to shareholders are \n\ndiscounted (the discount rate channel). Starting with the \n\ngrowth channel, we find that high market capitalization \n\ndoes not predict high future dividend growth at cyclical \n\nfrequency. Combined with recent evidence of slowing long-\n\nrun GDP growth and productivity in the US and glob-\n\nally (Fernald, 2015; Goldin et al., 2021 ), this suggests that \n\nhigh growth expectations are unlikely to be driving the in-\n\ncreases in market cap. \n\nWe also show that movements in discount rates can \n\nonly explain a small share of the observed capitaliza-\n\ntion increases. Even though safe interest rates declined \n\nmarkedly during this period, an increase in the equity risk \n\npremium meant that the rate at which future equity cash-\n\nflows are discounted fell by less than one percentage point \n\nafter the 1980s, accounting for about 10% of the increase in \n\nmarket cap to GDP ratios. This finding is in line with sev-\n\neral recent papers that document a stable rate of return on \n\ncapital and increases in the equity premium, and connect \n\nthese trends to increases in macroeconomic risk and short-\n\nages of safe assets (Caballero et al., 2017; Farhi and Gourio, \n\n2018; Gomme et al., 2015 ). \n\nThis leaves one other potential explanation of the post-\n\n1980s increases in market capitalization: an increase in \n\nthe listed firms’ profit share. We find that this channel is \n\nkey. Between 1870 and the 1980s, dividends paid by listed \n\nfirms fluctuated around the level of about 1.3% of GDP. The \n\n1990s saw listed firm dividends and earnings double, with \n\nthese increases continuing into the 20 0 0s. Our counterfac-\n\ntual analysis shows that this channel alone can explain 70% \n\nof the post-1980s increases in the market cap to GDP ra-\n\ntio, and combined with the lower discount rate, it can ex-\n\nplain almost all of the capitalization increase. Digging into \n\nthe drivers of this profit shift, we show that it was driven \n\nby increases in profit per unit of sales, rather than in-\n\ncreases in market shares (sales to gross output). This is in \n\nline with Gutiérrez and Philippon (2020) , who show that \n\nthere has not been a significant increase in the domes-\n\ntic and global market shares of dominant firms in recent \n\ndecades. \n\nWe further show that these profit increases go above \n\nand beyond the recently documented declines in the la-\n\nbor share and increases in capital income relative to GDP \n\n(Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013 ). The ratio of listed firms \n\nearnings to capital income has more than doubled since \n\n1990, and those countries that experienced the largest \n\ncapitalization increases during the big bang also recorded \n\nlarger increases in the earnings-to-capital-income ratio. \n\nThis means that the listed firm profit boom has, at least \n\npartially, come at the expense of other types of capital in-\n\ncome. \n\nWe find that two key counterparts of the profit shift \n\nwere declines in interest and tax expenses, which fell \n\nsharply after 1980 across advanced economies. The evi-\n\ndence on across-firm income redistribution is more mixed, \n\nwith the US listed firm profitability increases happening \n\nalongside those of other businesses. The importance of \n\nlower interest and tax costs in fueling listed firm profit \n\ngrowth helps explain why the post-1980s increases in prof-\n\nits and mark-ups have been accompanied by low levels of \n\nconsumer price growth and steady or increasing unit la-\n\nbor costs (Syverson, 2019 ). Overall, this evidence suggests \n\nthat within-capital-income shifts play an important role in \n\nshaping the distribution of wealth, and that interest rates            \n\n> 529 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n\ncan affect wealth not only directly through the discount \n\nrate, but also indirectly by changing corporate cashflows. \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. \n\nSection 2 describes the data, Section 3 describes the \n\ntrends in market capitalization, Section 4 breaks down \n\nthese trends into changes in prices and quantities, and \n\nSection 5 studies the underlying drivers of the post-1980s \n\nglobal stock market expansion. \n\n2.  A new cross-country stock market database \n\nThis paper introduces a new long-run dataset on stock \n\nmarket size and its drivers. The central feature of these \n\ndata is a new annual series of stock market capitalization \n\ncovering 17 countries from 1870 to 2016. The countries in-\n\ncluded are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, \n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, \n\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, \n\nand the United States. These are complemented by statis-\n\ntics on sources of market capitalization growth—issuances \n\nand capital gains—and the corresponding corporate funda-\n\nmentals in the form of listed firm profits and dividends. \n\nTogether, these data offer a new integrated assessment of \n\nstock market development and its underlying drivers over \n\nthe long run. \n\nOur market capitalization data measure the total mar-\n\nket value of all ordinary shares of domestic companies \n\nlisted on domestic exchanges at the end of each calen-\n\ndar year. We use a wide range of primary and secondary \n\ndata sources to construct these series, many of these new \n\nand previously unused. The secondary sources consist of fi-\n\nnancial history books and research articles, as well as var-\n\nious publications by stock exchanges, statistical agencies, \n\ncentral banks, and trade bodies. Where reliable secondary \n\nsources are not available, we construct the capitalization \n\nmeasure by aggregating the total market values of individ-\n\nual stocks, using data on stock prices and number of shares \n\nor listed capital value from stock exchange bulletins and \n\ngazettes, stock exchange handbooks, and companies’ pub-\n\nlished accounts. Most of these primary source data were \n\nnewly compiled through a series of archival visits to the \n\nrespective countries’ stock exchanges, central banks, and \n\nnational libraries, while some were also helpfully shared \n\nwith us by other researchers. We generally produce an-\n\nnual estimates of capitalization, but for instances where \n\nthese were not available, we obtained capitalization data \n\nfor benchmark years and constructed the annual series us-\n\ning changes in the book capital of listed companies and \n\nshare prices. In the Data Appendix, Tables E.1– E.17 and \n\nFigs. E.1– E.17 list the sources used for each country and \n\nshow a comparison of our estimates to those in previous \n\nstudies. \n\nExisting literature identifies four main challenges for \n\nderiving stock market capitalization estimates that are con-\n\nsistent across countries and over time. The first chal-\n\nlenge is that the capitalization series should only cover \n\nordinary shares and exclude other securities listed on \n\nthe stock exchange, such as preference shares and bonds \n\n(Hannah, 2018 , discusses these issues for the early Lon-\n\ndon Stock Exchange data). We therefore ensure that our \n\nestimates capture ordinary shares only, by constructing \n\nour own benchmark year estimates where necessary, and \n\nby using supplementary stock exchange data and research \n\npublications to make this distinction. \n\nThe second challenge is that the capitalization mea-\n\nsure should sum the value of all shares listed on every \n\nstock exchange within a country, net of any cross listings. \n\nWherever possible, we therefore rely on data that cover all \n\nthe major stock exchanges in the country, constructing our \n\nown estimates from microdata when necessary, as in the \n\ncase of the pre World War I German stock market cap (see \n\nData Appendix Table E.7). It is, however, not always possi-\n\nble to obtain information on the capitalization of smaller \n\nstock exchanges, especially one that goes beyond bench-\n\nmark years. For most countries in our sample, the bias \n\nfrom excluding smaller exchanges is small because by the \n\nlate 19th century, stock markets in many countries were \n\nalready quite centralised, and many securities that were \n\nchiefly traded on smaller markets were often also quoted \n\non the main stock exchange. These issues are most im-\n\nportant for the early US data, where several large regional \n\nexchanges and an active curb exchange were in operation \n\n(Sylla, 2006 ). For the US and several other countries we, \n\ntherefore, rely on benchmark year estimates to proxy the \n\nsize of regional and curb exchanges relative to the main \n\nmarket. \n\nThe third challenge relates to excluding foreign stocks. \n\nFor most of our estimates, the foreign stock share is either \n\nwell measured (e.g., in recent data) or small (as for most \n\nof the mid-20th century data), so the measurement issues \n\nmainly concern the large international stock exchanges in \n\nthe early 20th century, in particular the London Stock Ex-\n\nchange. We use secondary sources to adjust the equity \n\nmarket capitalization for foreign stocks whenever neces-\n\nsary, so the remaining biases should be small, with the \n\nmost likely direction leading us to slightly overstate the \n\ndomestic stock market capitalization in the financial cen-\n\nter countries during the early 20th century. In Appendix \n\nD.1, we discuss the data issues associated with foreign list-\n\nings in more detail. \n\nThe final challenge relates to the definition of a list-\n\ning. On the one hand, as highlighted by Rydqvist and \n\nGuo (2020) many shares that were listed on the smaller \n\nstock exchanges were traded rather infrequently in the late \n\n19th and early 20th century. On the other hand, some \n\nshares that were actively traded were traded in semi-\n\nofficial markets, such as the New York Curb Exchange. To \n\nbe consistent across countries and time, we generally stick \n\nto the standard definition of the listing as being quoted \n\non one of the stock exchanges in the country (i.e., being \n\npart of the stock listing) regardless of whether the stock is \n\ntraded often or not. The one exception we make is the New \n\nYork Curb Exchange, where trading was conducted infor-\n\nmally on the street before increasing formalization of trad-\n\ning activities beginning in the 1920s (Garvy, 1944 ). Here \n\nwe follow the typical approach of US financial historians \n\n(Sylla, 2006; O’Sullivan, 2007 ) and include the Curb Ex-\n\nchange in our capitalization totals. Excluding the Curb Ex-\n\nchange would reduce our US market capitalization esti-\n\nmates by around one-fifth for the pre-1920 period, based \n\non data shared with us by Prof. Leslie Hannah, and trading \n\nvolume statistics in O’Sullivan (2007) .           \n\n> 530 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n\nIn addition to the market capitalization series, we con-\n\nstruct estimates of, first, net equity issuance and capital \n\ngains, which allow us to decompose market cap move-\n\nments into prices and quantities; second, the market value \n\nof new listings, which allows us to proxy the market share \n\nof newly listed firms; and third, listed firm profits and div-\n\nidends, which allow us to assess whether changes in mar-\n\nket capitalization are driven by corporate fundamentals or \n\ndiscount rates. \n\nNet equity issuance measures the market value of all \n\nnew listings and secondary issues net of delistings and \n\nredemptions. These series are constructed from similar \n\nsources to our market capitalization data, with most of \n\nthe estimates coming from hand-collected microdata, com-\n\nplemented by estimates of financial historians, statisti-\n\ncal agencies, and central banks, and international flow of \n\nfunds data constructed by Richter and Diebold (2021) . The \n\nmain challenges when constructing the net issuance series \n\nlie in including all types of issuance, listings and delist-\n\nings, and accounting for their market value. To this end, \n\nwe seek to construct much of these series ourselves from \n\nmicrodata, but in some cases—as for example with some \n\nof the mid-20th century data for Germany—we combined \n\ndata on the book value of issuance with estimates of the \n\nlisted equity market-to-book ratio. Finally, we complement \n\nour net issuance data with an implied issuance estimate \n\ncomputed as the difference between market capitalization \n\ngrowth and the growth in the value-weighted equity price \n\nindex (see Section 4 for more details). This proxy has \n\nthe advantage that it should theoretically include all types \n\nof issuance, redemptions, and delistings valued at market \n\nprices, but the disadvantage is that it is constructed as a\n\nresidual and hence subject to larger measurement error. \n\nThe capital gains series are an updated version of the \n\ndataset in Jordà et al. (2019) extended to cover Canada \n\nand with the sources for all countries chosen to maximize \n\nconsistency in coverage and timing with the market cap \n\ndata, thus reducing the aforementioned measurement er-\n\nror in the implied issuance series. The series on the mar-\n\nket value of new listings aim to capture the total end-year \n\nmarket value of all IPOs and direct listings during the cal-\n\nendar year. To construct these, we primarily rely on mi-\n\ncrodata, complemented by statistics on IPOs (for example, \n\nthose in Chambers and Dimson, 2009; Kunz and Aggarwal, \n\n1994 ). When we cannot measure the market value of new \n\nlistings directly, we rely on supplementing and scaling the \n\nIPO proceeds and raw issuance data. The new listings se-\n\nries are available for five countries, with sources and esti-\n\nmation methods described in Data Appendix C. \n\nOur data on the profits and dividends of listed firms \n\nallow us to link movements in market capitalization to \n\nchanges in the underlying firm fundamentals. We com-\n\npute a long-run series of dividends paid by listed firms \n\nas the market capitalization times the dividend-price ra-\n\ntio from Jordà et al. (2019) , with an additional new series \n\nfor Canada. Since variation in payout ratios and means of \n\ncompensating shareholders makes dividends an imperfect \n\nmeasure of total cashflows to shareholders (Grullon and \n\nMichaely, 2002 ), we complement these dividend data with \n\nestimates of listed company earnings obtained from Com-\n\npustat Global and Compustat North America. The coverage \n\nof Compustat firms broadly matches that of our data, but \n\nfor some of the early observations in the late 1980s and \n\nearly 1990s, we drop country-years with insufficient data \n\n(less than 30% of total market cap) and scale the other ob-\n\nservations by the ratio of Compustat capitalization to our \n\naggregate capitalization estimates. \n\nThe Data Appendix contains a detailed description of \n\nthe sources for each of the three main new series— market capitalization, net issuance, and market value of \n\nnew listings—alongside a discussion of the various qual-\n\nity checks and comparison with existing estimates. In gen-\n\neral, our market capitalization data are in line with pre-\n\nvious country-specific estimates constructed by financial \n\nhistorians and statisticians. When it comes to the cross-\n\ncountry estimates of Goldsmith (1985) , our estimates are \n\ntypically below his national balance sheet data, because his \n\nestimates often include unlisted stocks, preference shares \n\nor bonds in the capitalization total, whereas ours focus \n\non listed ordinary shares only. Our estimates are some-\n\ntimes above and sometimes below those of Rajan and Zin-\n\ngales (2003) , depending on the specific country and time \n\nperiod. \n\nTaken together, we examine the largest and most de-\n\ntailed database of stock market capitalization and the \n\nsources of its growth to date. These data allow us to \n\nstudy the long-run evolution of stock market size and \n\nperform detailed accounting decompositions of its drivers \n\nacross a broad representative sample covering 17 advanced \n\neconomies. \n\n3.  Long-run trends in market capitalization \n\n3.1. Aggregate and within-country trends \n\nFig. 1 shows the ratio of stock market capitalization to \n\nGDP across the 17 countries in our sample for years 1870 \n\nto 2016. The solid blue line is the median, and the shaded \n\narea is the interquartile range of country-level data. The \n\nfirst century of our data saw several pronounced cycles, \n\nwith the median market cap to GDP ratio doubling be-\n\ntween the early 1890s and 1910, falling back to its 1880s \n\nlevels in the aftermath of World War I, increasing again \n\nin the 1950s, and falling to near-historical lows in the af-\n\ntermath of the 1970s stagflation. But all these cycles were \n\nlargely mean-reverting, with median stock market capital-\n\nization always eventually returning to its long-run average \n\nlevel of around one-third of GDP, and the cross-country in-\n\nterquartile range staying between 0.1 and 0.6 of GDP. \n\nAs a consequence, from the end of the 19th century \n\nand up until the late 1980s, the size of the stock mar-\n\nket evolved broadly in line with GDP. Over the subse-\n\nquent decades however, an unprecedented market expan-\n\nsion took place. The median market cap to GDP ratio in-\n\ncreased from 0.2 in 1980 to 1 in 20 0 0, with some coun-\n\ntries’ stock markets growing to three times the size of \n\ntheir domestic output. Moreover, this surge in stock mar-\n\nket cap seems to have been persistent. Despite the sharp \n\nequity price corrections in the early 20 0 0s and the Global \n\nFinancial Crisis of 20 08–20 09, market cap to GDP ratios to-\n\nday remain around three times larger than the historical \n\nnorm. We loosely term this post-1980s market expansion                                                \n\n> 531 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n> Fig. 1.

The solid line and the shaded area are, respectively, the median and interquartile range of the\n> individual country capitalization ratios in each year.\n\nas the big bang. 2 The left-hand panel of Appendix Fig. A.1 \n\nshows that this time series pattern—a century of variations \n\naround a stable mean followed by a sharp and persistent \n\nincrease—holds regardless of how we aggregate the indi-\n\nvidual country data, though value-weighted average capi-\n\ntalization levels are higher throughout the sample and dis-\n\nplay larger cyclical variation than both the median and the \n\nunweighted cross-country mean. \n\nFig. 2 shows that the same time series pattern is evi-\n\ndent not only across, but also within individual countries. \n\nThe solid black lines show the evolution of the market cap \n\nto GDP ratio in each country in our sample. In every single \n\none of these countries, the stock market grew rapidly dur-\n\ning the 1980s and 1990s and sustained this high level of \n\ncapitalization thereafter. In almost every country, the cap-\n\nitalization ratios reached during the 1990s and sustained \n\ninto the 20 0 0s were much higher than any past historical \n\npeaks. \n\nWhat exactly changed as a result of this post-1980s \n\nmarket expansion? How persistent was the observed in-\n\ncrease in market capitalization, and how does the vari-\n\nation in market cap during the last three decades com-\n\npare to the historical peaks and troughs? To help us an-\n\nswer these questions, we first test for structural breaks in \n\neach country’s market capitalization time series using the \n\nBai and Perron (2003) method. The vertical dashed lines in \n\nFig. 2 show the identified breaks in the mean of the mar-\n\nket cap to GDP ratio time series, and the solid horizontal \n\nlines show the corresponding period-specific means. The \n\nseries shown in the thick red lines are restricted to at most \n\none structural break per country, and the series in the thin \n\nblue lines do not impose a limit on the number of breaks. \n\nWhen we restrict the time series to having at most one                                                 \n\n> 2Note that our terminology is simply avisual description of the time\n> series pattern observed in the market capitalization data, and bears no\n> connection to the big bang market reforms in the UK. Our use of this term\n> does not imply that any of the observed rends were driven by market\n> liberalization.\n\nstructural break, the recent market capitalization increase \n\nis identified as the most important shift in the mean mar-\n\nket cap to GDP ratio in all countries bar one (Belgium). \n\nWhen we allow for multiple structural breaks, the struc-\n\ntural mean shifts identified for the pre-1980 time period \n\nare both much smaller and less persistent, with the his-\n\ntorical structural increases typically followed by similarly \n\nsized declines. \n\nWithout looking ahead into the future, we cannot tell \n\nif the post-1980s mean shift is permanent, but it is al-\n\nready larger and more persistent than the other histori-\n\ncal market capitalization increases both across and within \n\ncountries. This does not, however, imply that any given \n\npost-1980s market peak is likely to be long-lasting: on the \n\ncontrary, we have already observed much cyclical mean-\n\nreverting variation around this higher mean, with several \n\npronounced cycles, including the dot-com boom and bust \n\nin the late 1990s/early 20 0 0s. Similarly, the period be-\n\nfore the 1980s saw several short-run cycles alongside a\n\nlong-run cycle, consistent with the “great reversals” pat-\n\ntern identified by Rajan and Zingales (2003) , with low \n\nmid-20th-century levels of capitalization surrounded by \n\nthe 1900s and 1990s market peaks. We turn to analyze \n\nsuch cyclical variation next. \n\n3.2. Market capitalization cycles \n\nIn Fig. 3, we examine the volatility and persistence of \n\nmarket capitalization growth across different historical pe-\n\nriods. The left-hand panel confirms that market capitaliza-\n\ntion displays substantial cyclical variation throughout our \n\nsample period. The standard deviation of real market cap-\n\nitalization growth—the year-on-year change in market cap \n\nrelative to previous year’s market cap deflated by CPI—has \n\nbeen high both before and after 1985: around 20% for an-\n\nnual growth, and 7%–10% for average growth over horizons \n\nof 5 to 10 years. \n\nThe variation in market capitalization also tends to be \n\nhighly persistent. Not only does the growth volatility re-\n\n> 532\n\nD. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552 \n\nFig. 2.

This is largely due to the \n\nhighly persistent shifts in the time series mean that oc-\n\ncurred around the big bang. Within each of the pre- and \n\npost-1985 subsamples, market capitalization does tend to \n\neventually revert to its sample-specific mean—with auto-\n\ncorrelation coefficients approaching zero over time—but it \n\ndoes so at a very slow pace, reaching zero at horizons of \n\n7 to 15 years. The faster mean-reversion during the post-\n\n1985 period indicates that after the big bang, the cycles \n\nin market capitalization have become somewhat shorter, \n\nas for example evidenced by sharp capitalization increases \n\nduring the 1990s dot-com boom followed by rapid declines \n\nduring the subsequent market correction. \n\nEven though the growth of market capitalization has \n\nnot become substantially more volatile after the 1980s, \n\nmarket capitalization movements have become much big-\n\nger as a share of GDP as a consequence of the large \n\nlevel shift in stock market size. The right-hand panel of \n\nFig. 3 shows that the variation in market capitalization, \n\nwhen expressed as a share of GDP, more than doubled \n\nbetween the pre-1985 and post-1985 time periods, both \n\nat short and long horizons. Whereas historically the stan-\n\ndard deviation in stock market wealth was on the order of \n\n2%–7% of national income, depending on the horizon, after \n\n1985 these shocks have amounted to 20% of GDP at one-\n\nyear frequency and 5%–8% of GDP at longer horizons. Con-\n\nsequently, similarly-sized percentage movements in stock \n\nprices are likely to have much larger wealth effects today, \n\nand are hence more likely to influence household spend-\n\ning and real activity (Chodorow-Reich et al., 2021; Coron-\n\nado and Perozek, 2003; Poterba, 2000 ). \n\n3.3. International and institutional comparisons \n\nPrevious studies have often focused on capitalization \n\ndifferences across countries, and the associated links with \n\ninstitutional norms and financial development (La Porta \n\net al., 1997; Rajan and Zingales, 2003 ). The post-1980s in-\n\ncreases in stock market wealth took place across the 17 \n\ncountries in our sample, but they were not of equal size \n\neverywhere. Fig. 2 shows that while market cap in Switzer-\n\nland and Finland increased almost sixfold, the increase in \n\nBelgium was relatively modest and increases in France and \n\nthe UK took market capitalization back to previously seen \n\nhistorical peaks rather than all-time historical records. The \n\ncase of Portugal is also rather unique since the 1980s mar-\n\nket expansion mainly represented the re-emergence of the \n\nstock market after its near disappearance in the aftermath \n\nof the Carnation Revolution of 1974. This means that when \n\nwe look at the distribution of global market capitalization \n\nacross countries, we may see some changes—and this ex-\n\nactly what our data show. \n\nFig. 4 shows the share of each country’s stock market \n\nin the total of the 17 economies. We report separate shares \n\nfor the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan and lump the \n\nother 12 countries together. In late 19th century, capital \n\nmarkets were roughly equally divided between three ma-\n\njor players: the US, France, and UK. This distribution, how-\n\never, changed markedly during the subsequent 50 years. \n\nWhile the US was able to quickly increase its market share \n\nbetween 1880 and 1930, the French stock market’s global \n\nimportance more or less vanished. The UK’s market share \n\nalso dwindled, albeit at a slower pace than France’s. Af-\n\nter World War II, global equity markets became almost en-\n\ntirely dominated by the US, with US equities accounting \n\nfor roughly 70% of the advanced economy market cap in \n\n1950. 3\n\nEven though the US stock market has lost some of its \n\nglobal importance over recent decades, its size is still com-\n\nparable to that of the other 16 countries grouped together. \n\nNew equity markets have gained importance, with other \n\ncountries slowly catching up and Japan’s market share ex-\n\npanding during the high growth era after World War II and \n\neven temporarily catching up to the US at the peak of the                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\n> 3This dominance reflected the fact that the US stock market was rela-\n> tively large in proportion to GDP (Fig. 2,as well as the fact that the US\n> economy is large relative to the other countries in the sample, with the\n> US GDP accounting for about 50% of the 17-country total.\n> 534 D.

These market capitalization share \n\ncomparisons could be skewed by our exclusion of foreign \n\ncompanies listed on the country’s exchange—an issue that \n\nwe investigate in detail in Appendix D.1. We find that for-\n\neign listings are small from the UK, where total market \n\ncapitalization of foreign equity is comparable in size to \n\nthat of domestic equity. This means that the global market \n\ncapitalization shares in Fig. 4 understate the importance of \n\nLondon as a global financial center, particularly in the early \n\n20th century. \n\nThe increase in stock market cap was common not only \n\nacross countries, but also across different economic sectors. \n\nFig 5 shows the shares of different industrial sectors in to-\n\ntal market capitalization, computed using Compustat data \n\ngoing back to 1950 for the US (left-hand panel) and back \n\nto 1990 for the other countries in our sample (right-hand \n\npanel). US sectoral trends are characterized by a falling \n\nmarket share of manufacturing firms (dark blue area) and \n\nan increase in the market cap of financial and service com-\n\npanies (light and dark green areas). These trends, however, \n\nstarted before the 1980s and simply continued during the \n\nperiod of the big bang. For other countries in the sample \n\n(Fig. 5 right-hand panel), sectoral shares have remained re-\n\nmarkably stable since 1990, with market capitalization of \n\ndifferent industries increasing in tandem with one another. \n\nTo explore the connection between broader institutional \n\ncharacteristics and market size, the left-hand panel of                                                                         \n\n> 535 D.

Right-hand panel: Median market cap to GDP ratio and the ratios of total loans and total business loans to\n> GDP.\n\nFig. 6 displays the evolution of stock market capitalization \n\nseparately for countries with common law legal systems \n\n(UK, Canada, US, and Australia) and those operating under \n\ncivil law (the rest of our sample). La Porta et al. (1997) hy-\n\npothesised that stock markets in common law countries \n\ntend to be more developed because of the more market-\n\nfriendly legal norms. Consistent with the legal origins hy-\n\npothesis, common law countries had a persistently higher \n\nmarket cap to GDP ratio. Nevertheless, the post-1980 in-\n\ncrease in stock market cap “takes off” at a similar time and \n\nis similar in magnitude across both country groups. \n\nThe right-hand side of Fig. 6 compares the evolution of \n\nmarket capitalization to that of two proxies for banking \n\nsector development: total credit to the non-financial sec-\n\ntor (green triangles) and total non-financial business credit \n\n(orange circles). Over the very long run, both market cap-\n\nitalization and credit activity have grown faster than GDP. \n\nHowever both the timing and the duration of the late 20th \n\ncentury credit expansion are different to those in the stock \n\nmarket cap. Total credit starts increasing much earlier, and \n\ndoes so at a much slower pace than market capitalization. \n\nMoreover, the increase in business credit is much more \n\nmodest than that in total credit, largely because much of \n\nthe secular increase in credit during the second half of the \n\n20th century is driven by higher household mortgage debt \n\n(Jordà et al., 2016 ). The sharp increases in market capital-\n\nization in the post-1980s period happened at a time of rel-\n\native stability in the total volume of business loans. \n\nHow do our estimates compare to previous studies? \n\nOur Data Appendix includes detailed country level Figs. \n\nE.1–E.17 that show our final estimates alongside those of \n\nprevious researchers. Appendix Fig. A.1 shows that our \n\nbroad trends mirror those of Rajan and Zingales (2003) us-\n\ning all countries in their sample (dark triangles) or only \n\nthose countries present in both ours and their datasets \n\n(light diamonds). Our estimates are somewhat lower than \n\nthose of Rajan and Zingales (2003) , most likely because \n\nwe are able to take advantage of recent work by finan-\n\ncial historians (e.g., Annaert et al., 2012; López et al., 2005; \n\nWaldenström, 2014 ) and the raw stock listings data to at-\n\ntain an improved measure of the capitalization of ordinary \n\ndomestic shares that excludes preference shares and nets \n\nout cross listings between exchanges when necessary. Nev-\n\nertheless, the general patterns of high capitalization in the \n\n1910s and 1990s, and low capitalization in mid 20th cen-\n\ntury and especially around 1980, are clearly visible across \n\nalternative estimates. \n\nPrevious studies have often used market capitalization \n\nas a proxy for financial development, but the patterns in \n\nour data indicate a substantial divergence between stock \n\nmarket cap and other financial and institutional develop-\n\nment proxies. One reason for this is that financial devel-\n\nopment and institutions are more likely to affect quanti-\n\nties of listed equity through factors such as entry costs and \n\nmarket access, whereas our market capitalization measure \n\ncaptures short and long run movements in equity prices as \n\nwell as quantities. In order to gain a more discerned pic-\n\nture of the underlying drivers of stock market growth, we \n\nneed to decompose it into changes in prices and quantities, \n\nand separately assess the drivers of this price and quan-\n\ntity variation as well as their relative importance through \n\nhistory. The integrated nature of our database, and the in-\n\nclusion of consistent series of stock prices and quantities \n\nalongside those of capitalization, allow us to do exactly \n\nthat. \n\n4.  Trends in prices and quantities of listed equity \n\n4.1. Market capitalization growth decomposition \n\nMarket capitalization can grow through either quanti-\n\nties or prices of listed equity. Quantity variation typically \n\ncorresponds to firms’ financing decisions, market entry and \n\nexit, whereas changes in stock prices should be linked to \n\nchanges in company profits and the discount rates used \n\nto capitalize the profit stream into valuations. Decompos-\n\ning market capitalization growth into changes in prices and \n\nquantities, therefore, gives us a first pass at disentangling \n\nthe drivers of the long-run trends in Section 3.           \n\n> 536 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n\nOur price-quantity decomposition follows the standard \n\nprocedure in the studies of the US stock market and, more \n\nbroadly, household wealth (e.g., Bansal et al., 2007; Blanco \n\net al., 2020; Goyal and Welch, 2008; Piketty and Zucman, \n\n2014 ). To fix ideas, note that total market capitalization, \n\nMCAP , at time t is the sum of the market capitalizations \n\nof each individual share i, in turn calculated as the share \n\nprice Pi times the quantity of listed shares Qi :\n\nMCAP t =\n\n> Nt\n\n∑\n\n> i=1\n\nPi,t Qi,t . (1) \n\nAn increase in market capitalization can come about from \n\nshare issuance by listed companies (higher Q), new com-\n\npanies entering the listing (higher N), or higher prices of \n\nexisting listings P . Put differently, aggregate market capi-\n\ntalization is the sum of last year’s capitalization, MCAP t−1 ,\n\ntimes the capital gain during the year, and the net equity \n\nissuance consisting of new listings and secondary issues \n\nnet of delistings and redemptions: \n\nMCAP t = (1 + Capital gain t ) ∗ MCAP t−1 + Net issuance t .\n\n(2) \n\nDividing both sides by MCAP t−1 and deflating by CPI, real \n\nmarket capitalization growth, gMCAP , is the sum of the real \n\ncapital gain cg t and net issuance relative to the previous \n\nyear’s market cap iss t :4\n\ngMCAP  \n\n> t\n\n= cg t + iss t ,\n\nwhere gMCAP  \n\n> t\n\n= MCAP t ∗ CPI t−1\n\nMCAP t−1 ∗ CPI t\n\n− 1 and iss t = Net issuance t\n\nMCAP t−1\n\n.\n\n(3) \n\nThe decomposition in Eq. (3) is a pure accounting exer-\n\ncise and does not rely on any assumptions about the un-\n\nderlying sources of stock market wealth. Its different com-\n\nponents can be estimated directly from the data. We ob-\n\nserve market cap growth g and capital gains cg for all \n\ncountry-year observations in our sample, and for more \n\nthan half of the observations we also observe actual net \n\nequity issuance. For countries and years where we do not \n\nhave actual issuance data, we calculate it as the difference \n\nbetween market capitalization growth and equity capital \n\ngains. 5\n\nFig. 7 shows the decomposition of average cross-\n\ncountry market capitalization growth (solid black line) into \n\nreal capital gains (dark blue bars) and issuances relative \n\nto market cap (light green bars) following Eq. (3) . The \n\ncomponents also include a small residual, which comes \n\nabout from either the log approximation or the differ-\n\nences between implied issuance (market capitalization mi-\n\nnus capital gain) and actual issuance. All variables are \n\nsmoothed using five-year moving averages of annual data. \n\nStock prices are the main driver of cyclical variation in \n\nstock market cap: the stock market boom of the 1880s,                                                                 \n\n> 4Note that in Eq. (3) ,the market cap growth rate gand capital gain cg\n> can be either nominal or real, but for ease of interpretation across time\n> periods, we perform the decomposition with real growth rates.\n> 5This approach is very similar to Bansal et al. (2007) and Goyal and\n> Welch (2008) ,who calculate net issuance as the difference between CRSP\n> market cap growth and value-weighted capital gains.\n\nthe crashes during the world wars and the 1970s, and the \n\n1990s dot-com boom all had large impacts on real capital-\n\nization growth rates. Appendix Fig. B.1 provides additional \n\nevidence on the volatility of the price and quantity com-\n\nponent of market cap growth. It shows that capital gains \n\nare volatile, displaying a standard deviation of about 20% \n\nannually, 9% over five years, and still 6% after 10 years. Net \n\nissuance to market cap is on average about half as volatile \n\nas equity capital gains, but more persistent when looking \n\nat 5-year and 10-year intervals. \n\nWhen it comes to long-run stock market growth, how-\n\never, equity issuance is key. Table 1 shows the mean \n\nchanges in the market cap to GDP ratio and its compo-\n\nnents in the form of real capitalization growth, decom-\n\nposed into issuances and capital gains, and the growth in \n\nreal GDP over long periods of time. Column 1 covers the \n\nfull sample, and columns 2–4 cover the three main dis-\n\ntinct periods in the market capitalization trend: the pre \n\nWW I market expansion, the mid 20th century stagna-\n\ntion, and the post-1980s increase. The full sample averages \n\nconfirm that issuance played a key role in fueling market \n\ncap growth throughout history, amounting to about 3.6% \n\nof market cap per year, while real capital gains on average \n\ncontributed less than 1 percentage point per year to mar-\n\nket cap growth. Stock market cap to GDP ratios would ac-\n\ntually have fallen over time without the continuous inflow \n\nof new capital. \n\nYet the era of predominantly issuance-driven stock mar-\n\nket growth seems to have come to an end. Column 4 of \n\nTable 1 and Fig. 7 both show that the issuance component \n\nof market cap is gradually losing importance, only grow-\n\ning market cap by about 2.2% on average after 1985, and \n\nfalling close to zero after 20 0 0. Market cap growth over \n\nrecent decades has been predominately price driven, with \n\nreal capital gains amounting to about 3.7 ppts on average, \n\ncompared to the historical average of around zero. This \n\nnew era is markedly different from the mid-20th century \n\nperiod during which the market cap to GDP ratio stagnated \n\nbut net issuance remained above historical averages and \n\nthe average real capital gain was negative. \n\nThe observed trends in equity issuance are not an arte-\n\nfact of our way of measuring these data. For around half \n\nthe observations in our sample, we have data on actual net \n\nequity issuance, and for the other half we impute it as the \n\ndifference between market cap growth and capital gains. \n\nFor those countries where we have issuance data, both \n\nactual and implied issuance follow similar trends, with a\n\nsomewhat larger issuance boom in implied issuance in the \n\n1980s and 1990s, but a similarly sized fall in recent years \n\n(Appendix Fig. B.2a). The larger implied issuance boom in \n\nthe 1980s and 1990s is most likely because actual issuance \n\ndoes not fully account for revaluations of newly issued eq-\n\nuity at market prices, while these are fully incorporated \n\ninto implied issuance values. If we look at trends in eq-\n\nuity issuance relative to GDP as opposed to market cap, \n\nthe slowdown in issuance starts somewhat later as the \n\nrapid market expansion of the 1990s ensured that even \n\nthough issuance accounted for a declining share of stock \n\nmarket growth, the increases in the market cap to GDP ra-\n\ntio meant that it kept growing relative to GDP (Appendix \n\nFig. B.2b). \n\n> 537\n\nD.

Decomposing the recent stock market expansion \n\nIn this section, we examine the relative contribution of \n\nprice and quantity changes to the post-1980s acceleration \n\nin stock market growth. To assess this, the top panel of \n\nFig. 8 displays two counterfactual evolutions of the mar-\n\nket cap to GDP ratio during this time period, together with \n\nthe actual data (solid black line). The first counterfactual, \n\nmarked by red diamonds, shows what the market cap evo-\n\nlution after 1985 would have been if we fixed capital gains \n\nto their pre-1985 average. Under this scenario, all changes \n\nin the market cap to GDP ratio from 1985 onwards are at-\n\ntributable to changes in net issuance and real GDP growth. \n\nThe second counterfactual (blue triangles) instead fixes is-\n\nsuances to their pre-1985 mean and attributes all the post-\n\n1985 variation in the market cap to GDP ratio to changes \n\nin real capital gains and real GDP growth. We benchmark \n\nthe estimates so that the combined growth under the two \n\n538 D. Kuvshinov and K.

If real capital gains had remained at \n\ntheir historical average of around zero, the market cap to \n\nGDP ratio would have declined slightly due to the post-\n\n20 0 0 slowdown in net equity issuance. Counterfactual 2\n\nshows that fixing issuance to its historical levels results in \n\na market cap trend that closely follows actual data until \n\nthe early 20 0 0s, and then results in an even stronger mar-\n\nket expansion because this counterfactual eliminates the \n\nrecent issuance slowdown from the trends. \n\nFig. 9 shows that these aggregate trends are also re-\n\nflected in country-level data. The left panel shows the av-\n\nerage growth rate of market cap before 1985 decomposed \n\ninto capital gains and issuance, and the right panel shows \n\nthe average growth rate during the post-1985 market ex-\n\npansion. Almost all of the long-run growth in capitalization \n\nbefore 1985 was driven by issuances. But after 1985, the \n\npicture reverses with only the growth in the Portuguese \n\nstock market being issuance driven and the other countries \n\nbeing dominated by capital gains. The Portuguese case is, \n\nhowever, explained by country-specific events where the \n\nstock market more or less disappeared after the 1970s Car-\n\nnation Revolution and reemerged throughout the 1980s \n\n(see also the case study in Appendix Fig. B.5). Appendix \n\nFig. B.4 confirms that the largest post-1985 increases in \n\nthe market cap to GDP ratio were observed in countries \n\nwith the highest capital gains, rather than those with the                                                                                                   \n\n> 6The benchmarking ensures that the different timing of the shocks to\n> issuance and capital gains, and the correlation between the two, do not\n> bias our findings.

In addition, we estimate counterfactual \n\nmarket cap evolutions identical to Fig. 8 for the individ-\n\nual countries in Appendix Fig. B.3. The individual coun-\n\ntry counterfactuals are similar to the aggregate in Fig. 8,\n\nwith only Portugal and Australia experiencing substantial \n\nmarket growth under the fixed capital gain Counterfactual \n\n1, and all countries bar Portugal experiencing much larger \n\ngrowth under the fixed issuance Counterfactual 2. \n\nFig. 9 also shows that the post-1985 stock price in-\n\ncreases in the US are representative of broader cross-\n\ncountry patterns, with a number of Nordic countries in \n\nparticular experiencing even larger real capital gains. The \n\npositive contribution of the residual during the big bang \n\nperiod also, again, shows that revaluations of newly issued \n\nequity may have further accelerated this recent market cap \n\ngrowth. The slowdown in issuance is relatively more pro-\n\nnounced in the US, but it is by no means an outlier with all \n\ncountries bar Portugal reporting low issuance levels, and \n\nboth Switzerland and Sweden reporting issuance growth \n\ncontributions smaller than that in the US. \n\nOne reason why issuances have slowed so much could \n\nbe the increasing use of buybacks as means of compen-\n\nsating shareholders starting in the 1980s (Grullon and \n\nMichaely, 2002 ). Unlike dividends, buybacks reduce net \n\nequity issuance by lowering the number of shares out-\n\nstanding on the market. This means that the switch from \n\ndividends to buybacks could account for some of the is-\n\nsuance slowdown. Because the use of buybacks started ear-\n\nlier and was more common in the US (Megginson and Von \n\nEije, 2008 ), it could also account for some of the differ-\n\nences between the US and other countries. We quantify \n\nand discuss the contribution of buybacks to the growth de-\n\ncomposition trends in Section D.2 of the Appendix. We find \n\nthat without the switch to buybacks, post-1980s issuances \n\nwould have been somewhat higher and capital gains some-\n\nwhat lower, especially in the US. But the general patterns \n\nof falling issuances, less money flowing into the stock mar-\n\nket, and uncharacteristically high capital gains would have \n\nremained in place.                                                                          \n\n> 539 D.

Error bars show the 90% confidence bands.\n\nThe analysis in this section further confirms that the \n\nlast several decades have been highly unusual, with large \n\ncapital gains accelerating stock market growth beyond that \n\nof the real economy despite a slowdown in issuances. That \n\nbeing said, issuances were a key driver of stock market \n\ngrowth historically and continued to positively contribute \n\nto market capitalization growth even after 1985. \n\n4.3. Equity issuance cycles and determinants \n\nWe have shown that net issuance and capital gains fol-\n\nlow different long-run trends, with issuances being high \n\nhistorically and relatively modest in recent years and real \n\ncapital gains being low historically and high after 1980. It \n\nturns out that this disconnect between issuance and capi-\n\ntal gains is true for both the long and the short run. Fig. 10 \n\nshows the correlation between issuance (in year t) and \n\npast (years t − 4 to t), present (year t), and future (years \n\nt + 1 to t + 5) real capital gains. Issuance and capital gain \n\ncycles do not move together: the correlation between past \n\nand current capital gains and issuance in the full sample is \n\nclose to zero, and the correlation between current issuance \n\nand future capital gains is negative. This negative correla-\n\ntion confirms the Baker and Wurgler (20 0 0, 20 02) findings \n\nthat companies tend to time the market and issue equity at \n\nmarket peaks. We also find that the procyclicality of equity \n\nissuance has become stronger in recent decades. Whereas \n\nbefore 1985 (Fig. 10 middle panel) equity and past capital \n\ngains were uncorrelated, they became positively correlated \n\nafter 1985 (Fig. 10 right panel). \n\nThe evidence in Figs. 10 and 7 shows that both long and \n\nshort-run variation in issuance is distinct from that in cap-\n\nital gains. Given the large cyclical volatility in stock prices, \n\nthis makes it difficult to infer the time variation in quanti-\n\nties, as well as the associated changes in market access and \n\nfinancial development, from movements in market capital-\n\nization alone. Moreover, even the net issuance figures may \n\nmask large compositional changes between gross and net \n\nissues, and between new and old firms. To provide insight \n\ninto the underlying trends in issuance and their drivers, \n\nwe focus the rest of our analysis in this section on the \n\nvariation in net issuance and gross new listings. We in-\n\nvestigate the drivers of issuance by regressing different is-\n\nsuance measures on selected country and time character-\n\nistics, economic growth, and the cost of issuance, with re-\n\nsults shown in Table 2. In the regressions for columns 1– 3 we stick to our baseline net issuance measure, while \n\ncolumns 4–6 consider net issuance as a share of GDP in-\n\nstead of market cap, and columns 7–9 focus on gross new \n\nlistings (IPOs plus direct listings) rather than net issues. \n\nA number of robust explanatory variables for net issuance \n\nstand out. \n\nFirst, as suggested by the procyclicality of net issuance \n\nin Fig. 10 , all three of our proxies for issuance are strongly \n\ncorrelated with the relative costs of issuing debt and eq-\n\nuity. We proxy the cost of issuing equity by the dividend-\n\nprice ratio—with higher dividend yields indicating lower \n\nvaluations and a higher cost of equity—and the cost of is-\n\nsuing debt by the corporate bond yield, with bond yield \n\ndata taken from Kuvshinov (2021) . A one percentage point \n\nincrease in the dividend-price ratio predicts half a per-\n\ncentage point lower issuance relative to market cap (about \n\n0.1 ppts lower relative to GDP) and 0.3–0.7 percentage \n\npoints lower new listings relative to market cap. Higher \n\ncorporate bond yields show similarly-sized effects in the \n\nopposite direction, with a higher cost of debt leading firms \n\nto obtain finance through equity markets. We also find \n\nsome role for the business cycle. Issuance is positively cor-\n\nrelated with GDP growth, but the effect seems stronger for \n\nfirms already listed on the market than new listings, as ev-\n\nidenced by larger and more significant coefficients on GDP \n\ngrowth in columns 1–3 compared to in columns 7–9. \n\nSecond, we investigate the role of institutional charac-\n\nteristics. We find that issuance bears little correspondence \n\nto legal norms: common law countries tend to have higher \n\nmarket capitalization (right panel of Fig. 6) but lower net \n\nissuance and new listings (columns 1 and 7), perhaps be-\n\ncause the markets are already well established and a large \n\nshare of the country’s firms are already listed on the ex-\n\nchange. However, because capitalization in these countries \n\ntends to be large, their net issuance is larger as a share of \n\nGDP (column 4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n> 540 D.

The positive coeffi-\n\ncients on the market establishment dummy—set equal to \n\n1 in the first decade of the market data, or after a pro-\n\nlonged market closure—suggest that when stock markets \n\nbegin or resume operation, firms look to take advantage \n\nof these new funding opportunities to obtain equity fi-\n\nnance. This effect is stronger for new listings (columns 7– 9), but much larger as a share of market cap than GDP \n\npertaining to the fact that during these times, the coun-\n\ntry’s stock market tends to be small. The significance of the \n\nmarket establishment dummy is lower with year fixed ef-\n\nfects (columns 3, 6, and 9) because many markets in our \n\nsample were being established at similar time periods, re-\n\nducing the cross-sectional variation in this measure. The \n\nprevalence of new markets being established helps explain \n\nthe high issuance levels observed early in the sample: con-\n\nditional on the market establishment dummy, the pre WW \n\nI time period (Pre-1914 dummy) does not have signifi-\n\ncantly higher issuance. Appendix Fig. B.5 shows shows sev-\n\neral specific country case studies of market cap growth de-\n\ncomposition, which highlight that issuance was the driving \n\nforce of a number of historical market expansions, includ-\n\ning market growth after the foundation of the Helsinki and \n\nOslo stock exchanges, and the re-establishment of the Lis-\n\nbon Stock Exchange after the Carnation Revolution. \n\nFinally, the time dummy coefficients in Table 2 confirm \n\nthe broad secular trends evident in Fig. 7. While the pre-\n\n1914 issuance was relatively strong or at least not unusu-\n\nally low, the post big bang decades saw low levels of is-\n\nsuance, especially conditional on the low cost of issuing \n\nequity during this period. But interestingly, the trend is-\n\nsuance slowdown is much less evident when it comes to \n\nnew listings (columns 7 and 8), suggesting that net and \n\ngross equity issuance may follow different time trends. Af-\n\nter all, a post-1980s slowdown in net issuance does not \n\nnecessarily imply that all the growth and capital gains ac-\n\ncrued to firms already listed on the market in the early \n\n1980s. \n\nTo further look into this, we construct a measure of \n\nchurn—the market cap share of firms that were listed in \n\nthe last 10 years—for five stock markets in our sample. \n\nThere are two ways of measuring churn in our data. The \n\nmost accurate method splits the current market capitaliza-\n\ntion into firms listed in the last 10 years and those listed \n\nbeforehand, but the detail of the data only allow us to con-\n\nstruct this measure for the US. For the other countries, we \n\ncannot track the capitalization of individual firms for long \n\nperiods of time but we know the market cap of new list-\n\nings taking place within each year. To calculate the second \n\nproxy for churn, we take the ratio of the market cap of \n\nnew firms listed in one year to that of old firms, and sum \n\nthese ratios over a 10-year period. The second measure ig-\n\nnores post-listing growth differentials between new and \n\nold listings, but in practice these are small (see Appendix \n\nTable B.1 and Fig. B.6) and in the US, the two churn mea-\n\nsures are very close to each other (Fig. 11 top-left panel). \n\nFig. 11 shows the long-run evolution of the new list-\n\nings market share in five different countries. We see sub-\n\nstantial churn close to the stock market’s establishment \n\nand in the part of the sample period more generally. The                                                                                                                                              \n\n> 541 D. Kuvshinov and K.

The mid 20th century saw very little \n\nentry from new firms despite relatively high net issuance, \n\nsuggesting that most of the issuance throughout this pe-\n\nriod was from companies that were already listed. This \n\nsupports Rajan and Zingales (2003) ’ “great reversals” the-\n\nory that during this period of stagnation in market growth, \n\nstock markets were dominated by incumbents and there \n\nwas little entry from new firms. Throughout this time pe-\n\nriod, the market share of new listings generally remained \n\nat or below 10% of the value of old listings. \n\nThe 1980s saw a pickup in the amount of new equity \n\nentering the markets, but the size of this pickup differed \n\nmaterially across countries. The more established markets \n\nof the US, UK, and Switzerland recorded comparatively \n\nsmaller increases in churn. Sweden and Portugal, however, \n\nsaw large market entry and churn, much of it for institu-\n\ntional reasons. In Sweden, IPOs were not permitted un-\n\ntil 1979, although firms could still list directly, which is \n\nwhy the new listings for the pre-1979 period are above \n\nzero. Following market liberalization of the 1980s, there \n\nwas a large surge in market entry and IPOs, as discussed by \n\nRydqvist and Högholm (1995) . In Portugal, after the stock \n\nmarket more or less disappeared in the immediate after-\n\nmath of the Carnation Revolution, the eventual market re-\n\nestablishment saw the market share of new firms become \n\nmuch larger than that of old firms, by a factor of about 3. \n\nEven for the US, where the pick-up in churn was not as \n\nstrong as in Sweden and Portugal, by 2015 around half of \n\nthe total market capitalization was accounted for by firms \n\nlisted after 1985 (Appendix Fig. B.7). \n\n5.  Drivers of the post-1980s stock market growth \n\nThis section explores the drivers of the persistent equity \n\nprice increases that underpin the post-1980s expansion in \n\nstock market wealth. These drivers can be outlined within \n\nthe framework of the dynamic Gordon growth model. We \n\nfirst note that the ratio of market capitalization to GDP \n\nis approximately equal to the ratio of aggregate dividends \n\npaid by listed firms to GDP, Dagg /GDP , times the average \n\nvalue-weighted price-dividend ratio of the stock market \n\nPt /Dt :\n\nMCAP t\n\nGDP t\n\n=\n\n> Nt\n\n∑\n\n> i=1\n\n# ( Qi,t Di,t\n\nGDP t\n\n∗ Pi,t\n\nDi,t\n\n# )\n\n≈ Dagg \n\n> t\n\nGDP t\n\n∗ Pt /Dt , (4) \n\nwhere Dagg  \n\n> t\n\n= ∑Nt \n\n> i=1\n\nQi,t Di,t . We can then take logs on both \n\nsides and apply the Campbell and Shiller (1988) decompo-           \n\n> 542 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552\n\nsition to the log price-dividend ratio: \n\nl n\n\n# ( MCAP t\n\nGDP t\n\n# )\n\n≈ l n\n\n# ( Dagg \n\n> t\n\nGDP t\n\n# )\n\n+ E\n\n# ( ∞∑ \n\n> τ=0\n\n# ρ τ (dg t+τ +1 − rt+τ +1 )\n\n# )\n\n,\n\n(5) \n\nwhere dg is log real dividend growth, r is log real total re-\n\nturn, and ρ = P/D \n\n> 1+P/D\n\nis a linearization constant. Intuitively, \n\nEq. (5) is an approximate present value identity for the en-\n\ntire stock market. It tells us that the size of the stock mar-\n\nket relative to the economy is determined by three factors. \n\nThe first factor is the current profit share of listed firms, \n\nDagg /GDP . If listed firms’ profits and dividends constitute \n\na large share of economic income, the size of the stock \n\nmarket—which reflects the present value of these profit \n\nand dividend streams—will also be large relative to the \n\nrest of the economy. The second factor is the future profit \n\ngrowth (or dividend growth) dg : stocks can be valued \n\nhighly not only because profits are high today, but also if \n\nthey are expected to be high in the future. The third factor \n\nr is the discount rate , which capitalizes these future profits, \n\nwith lower discount rates increasing the present value of \n\nthe profit stream and leading to higher market capitaliza-\n\ntion. \n\nWe evaluate the relative importance of these three \n\ndrivers using a two-step procedure. First, we look at the \n\ncorrelations between market capitalization and its three \n\ndeterminants. As we cannot measure return and dividend \n\ngrowth expectations directly, we follow previous studies \n\n(Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Cochrane, 2008 ) and run pre-\n\ndictive regressions of future dividends and future returns \n\non current market capitalization. If high market capitaliza-\n\ntion predicts low future stock returns or high future divi-\n\ndend growth, this means that r and dg are relevant drivers \n\nof fluctuations in the size of the stock market. These cor-\n\nrelations tell us about which forces tend to drive the year-\n\non-year growth in the market cap to GDP ratio, but they \n\ndo not necessarily tell us what drives its long-run trend. \n\nTo this end, in the second step we look at the trends in \n\nthose variables that are correlated with market capitaliza-\n\ntion in the right direction in order to determine the contri-\n\nbution of these trends to the long-run evolution of market \n\ncap. \n\n5.1. Market capitalization, future returns, and dividends \n\nFig. 12 plots the correlations of market capitalization \n\nwith the three components of Eq. (5) : the current share of \n\ndividends in GDP, future growth of dividends, and future \n\nreturns. As in Eq. (5) , all the variables are in logs, and we \n\ncalculate present value discounted sums ∑∞  \n\n> τ=0\n\n## ρ τ dg t+τ +1\n\nand ∑∞  \n\n> τ=0\n\n## ρ τ rt+τ +1 by taking realized returns and divi-\n\ndends between year t and 2016, and assuming returns \n\nand dividend growth are equal to the respective country-\n\nspecific sample mean after 2016. 7 We also adjust market \n\ncap and dividends to GDP for structural breaks so that all                   \n\n> 7In Fig. 12 ,we annualize the discounted sums of rand gby multiplying\n> them by 1−\n\nρ.\n\nvariables are stationary to avoid potentially spurious cor-\n\nrelations, and postpone the questions of time series trends \n\nuntil the second step of the analysis in Sections 5.2 and \n\n5.3 . Not adjusting for structural breaks, however, leads to \n\nsimilar results. \n\nThe correlation between market capitalization, dividend \n\nshare in GDP, and future returns is in line with the the-\n\noretical predictions of Eq. (5) : a high market cap to GDP \n\nratio means high current listed firm dividends relative to \n\nGDP, and low future equity returns. But market capitaliza-\n\ntion and future dividend growth are, if anything, correlated \n\nin the wrong direction: high market cap actually predicts \n\nlow rather than high future dividend growth. \n\nWe further test these relationships by running predic-\n\ntive regressions of the following form: \n\nr j,t+1 = αr \n\n> j\n\n+ βr ln (MCAP j,t /GDP j,t ) + ur \n\n> j,t\n\n(6) \n\ndg j,t+1 = αdg  \n\n> j\n\n+ βdg ln (MCAP j,t /GDP j,t ) + udg  \n\n> j,t\n\n, (7) \n\nwhere j is a country index, α is a country fixed effect, and \n\nu is a Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard error clustered by \n\ncountry and year, and adjusted for serial autocorrelation. \n\nTable 3 reports the corresponding regression coeffi-\n\ncients βr and βdg for a range of different specifica-\n\ntions. The Campbell and Shiller (1988) decomposition in \n\nEq. (5) tells us that the regression coefficient on future re-\n\nturns βr should be negative, and βdg on dividend growth \n\nshould be positive. In the data, βr is negative and sta-\n\ntistically and economically significant, with a 10 percent-\n\nage point increase in the market cap to GDP ratio predict-\n\ning roughly 4 percentage points lower returns one year \n\nahead. 8 But market capitalization does not predict high \n\nfuture dividend growth: in some specifications the divi-\n\ndend predictability is negative, and in others it is statis-\n\ntically insignificant. These results hold if we restrict the \n\nsample to the post-1985 time period (columns 3 and 4), \n\ncontrol for common cross-country variation using year \n\nfixed effects (columns 5 and 6), and look at longer hori-\n\nzon returns (columns 9 and 10). Return predictability re-\n\nflects both future changes in the risk premium and the \n\nsafe rate (columns 7 and 8), and remains significant but \n\nsomewhat weaker when we do not adjust for structural \n\nbreaks (columns 5 and 6), consistent with US evidence \n\non other stock return predictors (Lettau and Van Nieuwer-\n\nburgh, 2008 ). \n\nTaken together, this means that market capitalization \n\ncorrelates with changes in the current profit share and \n\nfuture returns, but not with changes in future growth. \n\nTogether with the evidence of declining productivity in \n\nthe US and other advanced economies (Fernald, 2015; \n\nGoldin et al., 2021 ), this suggests that increases in fu-\n\nture expected—but not yet realized—dividend growth are \n\na rather unlikely driver of the big bang. Therefore, we fo-\n\ncus our analysis on the other two drivers and investigate \n\nwhether the post-1980s capitalization increases could have                              \n\n> 8A10 percentage point increase is roughly 25% in relative terms,\n> meaning a0.25 ×0.151 ×1.048 ≈0.0396 fall in real total return using the\n> coefficients in column 1.\n> 543\n\nD.

A declining discount rate \n\nSafe interest rates have declined markedly over the long \n\nrun (Del Negro et al., 2019; Holston et al., 2017; Schmelz-\n\ning, 2020 ). Much of this decline happened after 1980, a\n\nsimilar time period to that of the market expansion during \n\nthe big bang. This makes declining discount rates a natural \n\ncandidate for explaining the cross-country market capital-\n\nization increases observed after the 1980s. But the relevant \n\ndiscount rate for equity is the sum of the safe rate and the \n\nmarket risk premium. Using the Gordon growth model, we \n\ncan calculate the equity discount rate E(Rt+1 ) as the sum \n\nof the expected dividend-price ratio and expected future \n\ncashflow growth: 9\n\nE(Rt+1 ) = r sa f e + Risk premium ≈ E(Dt+1 /Pt ) + E( ˜gi,t+2 ).\n\n(8) \n\nThe left-hand panel of Fig. 13 shows the long-run \n\ntrend in a simple proxy of the equity discount rate and \n\na lower bound for the expected return on equities if ex-\n\npected cashflow growth is larger than zero—the dividend-\n\nprice ratio D/P . The dividend-price ratio has declined over \n\nthe long run, falling from 5% in the early 20th century \n\nto a low of 2% in 1990 before recovering to around 3% \n\nin 2016. Earnings-price ratios—which allow us to look  \n\n> 9\n\nThis is a levels version of the Campbell and Shiller (1988) decom-\n\nposition derived by Blanchard (1993) .

Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552                                              \n\n> Fig. 13.

Right-hand panel shows the level of the dividend-price ratio and nominal short-term interest rate in 2015.\n\nthrough changes in corporate payout policy, such as the \n\nincreasing use of stock buybacks during recent decades \n\n(see Grullon and Michaely, 2002; Megginson and Von Eije, \n\n2008 , and Appendix D.2)—show a similar declining pattern \n\nfrom the 1980s onwards. \n\nStill, these declines—especially the part that occurred \n\nafter the 1980s—are not as marked as the decline in the \n\nsafe rate, which fell from historically high levels in the af-\n\ntermath of the 1970s stagflation to around zero by 2015. \n\nThe right-hand panel of Fig. 13 shows the level of the \n\ndividend-price ratio and the nominal safe rate in 2015. As-\n\nsuming positive inflation, the nominal safe rate provides \n\nan upper-bound estimate of the real safe rate. For all the \n\ncountries in our sample, the dividend-price ratio is much \n\nhigher than the safe rate and the differences are sub-\n\nstantial, on the order of magnitude of several percentage \n\npoints. This suggests that even though the equity discount \n\nrate has decreased, equity risk premia were still sizeable \n\nand the discount rate was still relatively high in 2015. \n\nIn addition to studying the trends and levels of the raw \n\ndata, we also estimate the expected return E(R ) and the \n\ntrend real safe rate r sa f e . To do this, we first estimate ex-\n\npected cashflow growth by constructing a long-run fore-\n\ncast of future dividends. This forecast is the average of two \n\nproxies from Kuvshinov and Zimmermann (2020) , the first \n\nof which forecasts future dividends using current asset val-\n\nuations within a flexible time-varying VAR specification, \n\nand the second of which equates the long-run dividend \n\ngrowth rate to a long-run GDP growth forecast. 10 For the \n\nsafe rate, we extend the Del Negro et al. (2019) estimates \n\nof the trend long-term real government bond yield to the \n\n17 countries in our sample.                                                                                    \n\n> 10 We use the average of these two forecasts to provide abalanced per-\n> spective.

For more detail on the expected risky and safe return estimation,\n> see Kuvshinov and Zimmermann (2020) .\n\nThe resulting expected return estimate, pictured as the \n\nblue line in the left-hand panel of Fig. 14 , displays a sim-\n\nilar trend to the dividend- and earnings-price ratios but a\n\nslightly smaller long-run decline due to moderate increases \n\nin the expected cashflow growth offsetting some of the de-\n\ncline in equity price ratios (Eq. (8) ). Like with the dividend-\n\nprice and earnings-price ratios, the post-1980s decline in \n\nthe expected equity return is much smaller than that in \n\nthe safe rate (dark green area). Correspondingly, the dif-\n\nference between the two, the equity risk premium (light \n\nblue area) has increased materially since 1990. These broad \n\ncross-country patterns are mirrored in country-level data. \n\nThe right-hand panel of Fig. 14 shows the change in the \n\nreal safe rate and the risk premium, as well as their sum, \n\nthe expected return, between the 1980s and 2015. In all \n\ncountries, the trend real safe rate has declined while in \n\nall bar three, the risk premium has increased. No country \n\nregisters a large risk premium decline. These patterns hold \n\nregardless of the way we measure the expected risky and \n\nsafe returns in the data. \n\nThe post-1980s trends in risky and safe discount rates \n\nare consistent with existing evidence on the falling safe \n\nrate, stable return on productive capital, and a rising eq-\n\nuity premium in the US (Caballero et al., 2017; Gomme \n\net al., 2015; Summers and Rachel, 2019 ). Existing literature \n\noffers several explanations for these trends, which cen-\n\nter around either a higher demand or a lower supply of \n\nsafe investments—both factors that would push down the \n\nsafe rate and increase the risk premium (Caballero et al., \n\n2017; Farhi and Gourio, 2018; Kuvshinov and Zimmer-\n\nmann, 2020 ). The increases in the market cap to GDP ratio \n\nmay have actually contributed to the increases in demand \n\nfor safety by increasing the volatility of equity wealth rela-\n\ntive to income (right-hand panel of Fig. 3), thereby increas-\n\ning the risk exposures of equity investors and risk premia. \n\nTaken together, these trends mean that even though \n\nlow equity discount rates have contributed to the increases \n\nin market capitalization during the big bang, they are un-\n\nlikely to be its main driver. We next explore a third poten-                                                                                                                 \n\n> 545 D. Kuvshinov and K.

A profit shift towards listed firms \n\nThe profits of US corporations have increased markedly \n\nover recent decades (Barkai, 2020 ). Our data allow us to \n\nput these recent US trends into a cross-country historical \n\nperspective, and show that the corporate profit boom is \n\nglobal, historically unprecedented, and a key driver of the \n\npost-1980s increases in market capitalization across ad-\n\nvanced economies. We further show that these increases \n\nhave been driven by higher profit margins rather than mar-\n\nket shares, and that the profits of listed firms have grown \n\nmuch faster than other types of capital income. \n\nWe start by examining long-run trends in the ratio of \n\nlisted firm profits to GDP. The solid blue line in Fig. 15 \n\nshows that the share of listed firm dividends in GDP has \n\nroughly tripled between the 1980s and 2015—an increase \n\ncomparable to that in the market cap to GDP ratio. These \n\nrecent increases are also mirrored in earnings data, which \n\nallow us to look through the impact of changes in payout \n\npolicy on the trends. The orange diamonds in Fig. 15 show \n\nthat measures of listed firms earnings, computed from \n\nCompustat Global and North America, display similar rel-\n\native increases to dividends, measured either in our long-\n\nrun data or in the same Compustat sample. Longer-run US \n\ndata from Shiller (2015) show that the recent earnings in-\n\ncreases are also unusually large and persistent relative to \n\nthose observed historically since 1870 (see Appendix Fig. \n\nC.1). Appendix Fig. C.2 further documents that these in-\n\ncreases in earnings were not accompanied by significant \n\nchanges in leverage. \n\nAs the next step, we decompose the increase in listed \n\nfirm profits to GDP into a quantity component and a price \n\ncomponent. A rise in profits can either come from the ris-\n\ning market shares of listed firms, or a higher profit rate per \n\nunit of revenue. Starting with market shares, the left-hand \n\npanel of Fig. 16 displays the ratio of total sales of listed cor-\n\nporations to domestic gross output from national accounts \n\nin 1990 and 2016. We do not observe that listed firms have \n\nexpanded their sales systematically relative to the gross \n\noutput of their home economy. While listed firms have \n\ngained in importance in some countries, they have lost \n\nmarket shares in others. This finding aligns with Gutiérrez \n\nand Philippon (2019, 2020) , who show that market leaders \n\n(stars) have not materially grown their market shares in \n\nthe US and globally. Instead, the profit boom of listed cor-\n\nporations seems to be driven by an increase in profitability \n\nper unit of sales. The right-hand panel of Fig. 16 shows the \n\nsales-weighted average dividend per sale ratio in 1990 and \n\n2016. We observe a strong increase in the profit margin \n\nof listed firms across advanced economies. This holds not \n\nonly for the dividend-to-sales ratio, but also for other prof-\n\nitability measures such as net income to sales or market \n\ncap to sales (see Appendix Fig. C.3) and across sectors of \n\nthe economy (see Appendix Fig. C.4). We conclude that the \n\nrise in listed firm profits relative to GDP is largely driven \n\nby an increase in the profit margin. \n\nPrior studies suggest that the profit margins of US cor-\n\nporates have been high before (Barkai and Benzell, 2018; \n\nTraina, 2018 ). We replicate this result in the left-hand \n\npanel of Fig. 17 . The profit margin of listed firms in the \n\nUS a U-shaped pattern, with high levels in the 1950s, low \n\nlevels in the 1980s and 1990s, and high levels again af-\n\nter 2010. Why did these high profit margins not translate \n\ninto high profit shares and market capitalization during the \n\n1950s? The reason for this is that, even though profit mar-\n\ngins were high, listed firm sales were small relative to the \n\nrest of the economy. The right-hand panel of Fig. 17 shows \n\nthe evolution of the estimated market share of listed cor-\n\nporations in the US, again measured using the sales to \n\ngross output ratio. Listed firms’ market share was low in \n\nthe 1950s at around one-third of gross output, increased in \n\nthe 1960s and 1970s, and remained at around 50% of gross \n\noutput throughout subsequent decades. The rising market                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\n> 546 D.

We calculate total listed firm sales in Compustat and rescale it by the coverage ratio of Compustat to total market cap\n> to account for coverage changes in Compustat. The Compustat coverage in Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden is still low in 1990, meaning that the 1990\n> figures for these countries should be interpreted with caution. For Portugal, we use 1994 data for the 1990 data point, as it is the first year with meaningful\n> coverage. Gross output comes from the OECD STAN database, the EU KLEMS database, and the BEA.

The data are aggregated to the country level by weighting firm level data from Compustat by total sales.\n\nshare of listed firms was actually part of a much broader \n\nshift away from unincorporated businesses towards corpo-\n\nrations (both C-corporations and S-corporations) in the US, \n\nwhich took place between 1950 and 1980 (see the left-\n\nhand panel of Appendix Fig. C.5). Thus, the negative im-\n\npact of declining profit margins in the 1960s and 1970s \n\nwas offset by the rising market share, with these two ef-\n\nfects largely cancelling out to leave the listed firms profits \n\nand market capitalization shares and GDP stable through-\n\nout this time period. \n\nThe post-1980s increases in listed firm profits relative \n\nto GDP suggest that there has been a redistribution of in-\n\ncome away from other sectors of the economy towards \n\nlisted firms. This redistribution could have come about \n\nfrom either labor income or other forms of capital income. \n\nKarabarbounis and Neiman (2013) have shown that the \n\nshare of labor income in GDP has fallen since the 1980s, \n\nand in a contemporaneous paper to ours, Greenwald et al. \n\n(2021) argue that the decline in the labor share is a key \n\ndriver of the increase in US stock market capitalization. To \n\ninvestigate the contribution of this channel to the long-run \n\ncross-country increases in capitalization across countries, \n\nthe left-hand panel of Fig. 18 shows the long-run evolution \n\nof three different capital share measures for six advanced \n\neconomies. We take gross and net capital shares from \n\nBengtsson and Waldenström (2018) , and use the balance \n\nsheet net rental income data from Jordà et al. (2019) to \n\nfurther adjust these for rents.                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n> 547 D.

Listed firm earnings are smoothed using afive-year moving average.\n\nThe trends suggest that changes in the capital share \n\nplay relatively little role in explaining the rising listed \n\nfirm profit share. While the gross capital share (green \n\ndiamonds) has indeed increased substantially since the \n\n1980s, the net-of-housing net capital share (blue cir-\n\ncles) has remained broadly flat, in line with evidence \n\nin Rognlie (2015) and Gutiérrez and Piton (2020) . Fur-\n\nthermore, both gross and net capital shares, if any-\n\nthing, have declined slightly over the long run and were \n\nmuch higher during the late 1930s—a time of low mar-\n\nket capitalization—than they are today. Correspondingly, \n\nthe right-hand panel of Fig. 18 shows that the ratio of \n\nlisted firms’ earnings to net capital income has increased \n\nmarkedly during the recent decades, rising from 10% in \n\n1990 to 25% in 2015. These increases are historically un-\n\nprecedented, with the ratio of listed dividends to capital \n\nincome standing at an all-time historical high of 15%. \n\nWithin-capital-income shifts not only account for a\n\nlarge proportion of the time series trend, but also for \n\ncross-country differences in market capitalization increases \n\nduring the big bang. Fig. 19 a shows that countries with \n\nthe highest post-1980s market capitalization increases also \n\nrecorded the largest shifts within capital income towards \n\nlisted firm profits, but generally did not record larger in-\n\ncreases in the capital share. The left panel shows that \n\nwhile the US recorded increases in both the capital share \n\nand market capitalization, many European countries such \n\nas Sweden and the Netherlands recorded historically un-\n\nprecedented increases in market capitalization despite \n\nfalling net capital shares. The middle and right panels \n\nshow that country-level changes in dividend and earnings \n\nshares are positive in every country and strongly correlated \n\nwith the magnitude of the increase in stock market cap. \n\nWith the exception of the US, the patterns in earnings and                                                                                                                 \n\n> 548 D.

It displays binned scatter plots of market cap against, \n\nrespectively, net capital share in GDP, listed firm dividend \n\nshare in net capital income, and listed firm earnings share \n\nin net capital income, divided into 100 bins. Capital shares \n\nare uncorrelated with market capitalization, while divi-\n\ndend or profit shares and market cap are strongly posi-\n\ntively correlated. \n\nWhat types of capital income might have fallen to com-\n\npensate for the increase in listed firm earnings? Our anal-\n\nysis suggests that falls in interest expenses and corpo-\n\nrate taxes were key. Fig. 20 shows the cross-country aver-\n\nage corporate tax rate, as well as the post-1990 country-\n\nlevel changes in the interest expense to sales ratio. The \n\nleft-hand panel shows that corporate tax rates declined \n\nconsiderably after 1980, meaning that corporations could \n\ndistribute more money to shareholders without necessar-\n\nily making higher pre-tax profits. But even pre-tax listed \n\nfirm profits increased considerably, partly owing to large \n\ndeclines in costs in the form of interest expenses docu-\n\nmented in the right-hand panel of Fig. 20 . One common \n\nfeature of these two trends is that they have the poten-\n\ntial to generate an increase in corporate profitability while \n\nleaving capital shares largely unaffected. These declines in \n\ncosts also help explain how profit margins and markups \n\nmay have risen at a time of low price growth and steady or \n\ngrowing unit labor costs (Syverson, 2019 ). A detailed cap-\n\nital income breakdown for the US shown in the Appendix \n\nFig. C.6 confirms that these tax and interest declines were \n\n> 549\n\nD. Kuvshinov and K.

Interest expenses and sales are \n\nsales-weighted averages of firm-level data from Compustat Global and Compustat North America. The Compustat coverage in Italy, Portugal, Spain, and \n\nSweden is still low in 1990, meaning that the 1990 figures for these countries should be interpreted with caution. For Portugal, we use 1994 data instead \n\nof 1990 as it is the first year with meaningful coverage. \n\nTable 4\n\nContribution of shifts in profits and discount rates to the big bang. This table shows the counterfactual evolution of the market cap to GDP ratio during the \n\nbig bang under different scenarios. Counterfactual market cap is calculated as D/GDP ∗ 1/[E(r) − E(g)], where D/GDP are dividends paid by all listed firms \n\nrelative to GDP, E (r) is the expected return on equities, and E(g) is expected real dividend growth. For all counterfactuals, expected real dividend growth is \n\nset to the sample average of 2.3%. The profit shift only counterfactual keeps the expected return at its 1980s average and allows the dividend-to-GDP ratio \n\nto increase to its 2015 level. The discount rate decline only counterfactual keeps the dividend-to-GDP ratio at its 1980s average and allows the discount \n\nrate to fall to its 2015 level. Columns (1) and (2) show the average market cap to GDP ratios for the specific time period across the pooled sample of 17 \n\ncountries, and columns (3) and (4) display, respectively, the absolute and relative change in these ratios between the 1980s and 2015. \n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) \n\n1980–1989 average 2015 Change in MCAP/GDP Share of increase in the data \n\nActual MCAP/GDP 0.30 0.97 0.67 \n\nCounterfactual MCAP/GDP: \n\nProfit shift only 0.26 0.74 0.48 71% \n\nDiscount rate decline only 0.26 0.32 0.05 8% \n\nCombined 0.26 0.89 0.63 94% \n\nthe largest counterparts of the profit increases during the \n\nrecent decades. 11 \n\nWhen it comes to shifts from profits of unlisted busi-\n\nnesses towards those of listed firms, the evidence is more \n\nmixed. In the US, the increases in profits of listed firms \n\nhappened alongside those of other businesses with profit \n\nmargins of listed and unlisted corporations, and of dif-\n\nferent forms of business (C-corporations, S-corporations, \n\npartnerships and sole proprietorships) all increasing ma-\n\nterially since the 1980s (see Appendix Fig. C.7). In fact, \n\nSmith et al. (2019) identify the profit boom in unlisted \n\n“pass-through” businesses as one of the key drivers of in-\n\ncome growth at the top of the income distribution. Outside \n\nof the US, countries registered much smaller increases in \n\nthe total capital share and gross operating surplus to value \n\nadded (Fig. 19 panel (a) and Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2018 )\n\nand corporates did not lose market share to non-corporate \n\nbusinesses (Saez and Zucman, 2020 ). These trends suggest  \n\n> 11\n\nSuch a breakdown of capital income is to our knowledge not available \n\nin countries that follow the SNA instead of the NIPA national accounts \n\nguidelines, which only reports gross operating surplus. \n\nthat the growth and profitability increases of unlisted busi-\n\nnesses that we see in the US might be less pronounced in \n\nother countries. \n\nTo sum up, the big bang was accompanied by large in-\n\ncreases in the listed firm profit share—the ratio of listed \n\nfirms’ earnings to GDP. These increases in profits were \n\nglobal, happened at a much faster pace than the economy-\n\nwide increase in capital shares, are comparable in size to \n\nthose in market cap, and—especially in their cross-country \n\nscope—are historically unprecedented. \n\n5.4. Accounting for the big bang \n\nIn this section, we quantify the contribution of individ-\n\nual drivers to the increases in the market cap to GDP ratio \n\nsince the 1980s. To determine this, we run a simple coun-\n\nterfactual exercise of the following form: we allow either \n\nthe profit share or the discount rate to vary with the actual \n\ntrend observed in the data, but fix all the other market cap \n\ndeterminants at their 1980s levels. We then estimate the \n\ncounterfactual market cap using a constant-growth Gordon \n\n550 D. Kuvshinov and K. Zimmermann Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 527–552 \n\nmodel version of Eq. (5) :\n\nMCAP t\n\nGDP t\n\n≈ Dagg \n\n> t\n\nGDP t\n\n∗ 1\n\nE(rt+1 ) − E(gt+1 ) . (9) \n\nTo ascertain the relative importance of the different chan-\n\nnels, we compare the counterfactual increase in market cap \n\nobtained by varying the profit share D/GDP or the discount \n\nrate E(r), and keeping other factors constant to the actual \n\nincrease observed in the data. Throughout this counterfac-\n\ntual exercise, we fix expected dividend growth E(g) at its \n\nlong-run mean level of 2.3% p.a. 12 \n\nTable 4 shows the actual market cap to GDP ratio before \n\nand after the big bang in the top row and the counterfac-\n\ntual market cap levels under various scenarios in the bot-\n\ntom rows. Column 1 shows the actual and counterfactual \n\nmarket cap levels during the 1980s, the decade before the \n\nbig bang. Column 2 shows the average level after the big \n\nbang, in 2015. Columns 3 and 4 show the resulting mar-\n\nket cap increases. Starting with column 1, the average level \n\nof market cap in the 1980s was around 30% of GDP. Dur-\n\ning this period, dividends were around 1% of GDP and ex-\n\npected equity returns were on average 6.1%. Plugging these \n\ninto Eq. (9) gives us a counterfactual market cap to GDP \n\nratio of 1/(6.1 − 2.3) ≈ 0.26 , close to the ratio of 0.3 in \n\nthe data, which is a starting point for all our counterfac-\n\ntual scenarios. \n\nIn the second row of Table 4, we allow the profit share \n\nD/GDP to increase to its 2015 average of 2.8%, while keep-\n\ning the discount rate constant at 6.1%. This gives us a\n\n2.8/(6.1 − 2.3) ≈ 0.74 counterfactual level of market cap in \n\n2015, and a 48% of GDP increase in market cap during the \n\nbig bang, which is around 71% of the total. In the third row, \n\nwe allow the discount rate to fall from 6.1% to 5.5% while \n\nkeeping dividends-to-GDP constant at 1%, which gives us a\n\n1/(5.5 − 2.3) ≈ 0.32 counterfactual 2015 market cap level \n\nand a 5% of GDP increase, around 8% of the total. Together, \n\nthese two factors amplify each other as higher cashflows \n\nare discounted at a lower rate. Allowing for both the profit \n\nshift and the discount rate decline in the bottom row re-\n\nsults in a 2.8/(5.5 − 2.3) ≈ 0.89 counterfactual 2015 mar-\n\nket cap level, and an increase of 63% of GDP accounting \n\nfor 94% of the total increase in market cap during the big \n\nbang. 13 \n\n6.  Conclusion \n\nThis paper introduced a new dataset of stock mar-\n\nket capitalization and its drivers—issuances, prices, divi-                                                                                                                                                \n\n> 12 Expected dividend growth is calculated as the average of the long-run\n> forecast of dividends and real GDP growth, consistent with our estimate\n> of the expected return in Eq.

A high-level investi-\n\ngation of the data reveals two broad eras of stock mar-\n\nket growth: the period before the 1980s, during which the \n\nstock market grew at the same long-run rate as GDP and \n\nthis growth was driven by equity issuance; and the period \n\nafter the 1980s, during which capitalization growth accel-\n\nerated far beyond that in GDP, with this acceleration driven \n\nby sharp persistent increases in stock prices at a time of \n\nslowing issuance. \n\nWe show that the key driver of these post-1980s in-\n\ncreases in market capitalization is a profit shift away from \n\nother parts of the economy towards listed firms. This profit \n\nshift is driven by higher profit margins, goes well beyond \n\nthe recently documented increases in capital income, and \n\nhas been aided by falls in interest expenses and corporate \n\ntaxes. These trends are consistent with broader patterns of \n\nincreasing market power and profitability of large firms in \n\nthe US and globally (Barkai, 2020; De Loecker et al., 2020; \n\nDe Loecker and Eeckhout, 2018 ). We also show that low \n\nsafe rates and falling discount rates have made a relatively \n\nsmall direct contribution to the big bang, but generated \n\nsizeable falls in interest expenses, which provided an im-\n\nportant indirect contribution to the observed increases in \n\nprofits and, through this, the expansion in market cap. \n\nSupplementary material \n\nSupplementary material associated with this article can \n\nbe found, in the online version, at doi: 10.1016/j.jfineco. \n\n2021.09.008 \n\nReferences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n\n> Annaert, J. ,Buelens, F. ,De Ceuster, M. ,2012.
