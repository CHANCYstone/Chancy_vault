I am an assistant professor at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YangsiyuLU/yangsiyulu) and a research associate with [University of Oxford](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/yangsiyu-lu/)'s Institute for New Economic Thinking. Before joining HKUST(GZ), I worked as a research fellow at Paris School of Economics and Boston University.

I lead the [Energy Infrastructure and Climate Policy (EICP) Lab](https://eicp-lab.github.io/) at HKUST(GZ). My multi-disciplinary research focuses on energy, climate and the environment. I am particularly interested in three areas: 1) Transition of fossil fuel assets, 2) Development of clean technologies, and 3) Management of climate risks. 

Prior to pursuing an academic career, I worked for international organisations (UNEP in Japan), corporates (Pernod Ricard in France) and non-profit organisations (Green Startups Accerlerator in China). 

I am fluent in Chinese(native), English and French. 

  

Education:

- PhD in Environmental Economics, University of Oxford
    
- Master in Environmental Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
    
- Master in Energy and Environment, IMT Mines Albi (France)
    
- Bachelor in Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
    

  

I'm recruiting a PhD candidate to work on energy modeling for 2026 intake. Potential candidates are welcome to send their CV, research proposal, and transcripts to get in touch. Full scholarship provided!
