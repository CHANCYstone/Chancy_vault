The maps illustrate the current layout of an industrial area in the town of Norbiton and its planned future development. The main objective of the planned changes is to improve the livability of the industrial area.

Currently, the Norbiton industrial area consists of four main elements: farmland, a river, factories, and residential towns. However, there is limited connection between these areas, and basic public services are lacking.

The proposed development plans aim to address these issues by introducing new facilities, such as shops, a medical center, a school, and a playground. These additions will significantly diversify the industrial area and improve its livability. Furthermore, a bridge is planned to be built across the river, which will integrate the farmland into the area, creating a more cohesive environment and enabling the farmland to contribute to the development of the region.
 
If the planned development is successfully implemented, it will play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for residents and improving the overall functionality of the area.
