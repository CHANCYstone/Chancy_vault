Abstract \n\nDespite widespread recognition of its importance, very little empirical research has been conducted on strategy documents, particularly Mission or Vision statements. A database containing 489 organizational statements from 300 different organizations was analyzed via content analysis to determine how many distinct concepts could be identified and the most commonly used con-cepts. Statements were carefully read to deter-mine if multiple use of a term within a single statement indicated multiple meanings. The results indicate that while traditional titles are most often used to label such statements, there is a wide variety of terms used to express the ideas contained in them. Many organizational state-ments contain so many unique concepts that they begin to suffer from high density. \n\n# Introduction \n\n“Typically, executives devote a tiny percentage of their time and effort to gaining understanding, a tiny percentage to creating alignment, and the vast majority to documenting and writing a statement. In fact, the distribution of time and effort should be nearly the opposite: spend the vast majority of your time creating alignment . In short, worry about what you do as an organization, not what you say” (Collins, 2009). The field of business ethics has been around for quite awhile. Unfortunately it has yet to develop a generally recognized body of knowledge or an applied ethical perspective. What we have today are discourses on acceptable and unacceptable \n\n63 Volume 29 \u0003 Number 1 \u0003 Spring 2011 \n\n# Mission, Vision, and Values: \n\n# What Do They Say? Steven H. Cady, Jane V.

These contributions, all equally valuable, are from busi-ness academics and philosophers alike. Yet, there is no true agreement between these sides (Robin, 2009). In 2002, because of unethical practices employed by the likes of Enron, we saw the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which called for a Code of Ethics. Then in 2008 and 2009 we saw the virtual melt down of the American corporate system. Not surprisingly, practitioners and academics alike, now more than ever, need to delineate the factors that make up the ethical organization (Jin & Drozdenko, 2010). It seems that people are not listening. Recent data from the Ethics Resource Center show that over 50% of U.S. employees watched at least one occurrence of unethical conduct in the workplace during the past year. Further, more than a third watched a second as well (Verschoor, 2005). Jim Collins, the management expert quoted above, seems to be suggesting that there is a mis-alignment between a company’s message and its actions (Collins, 2009). One piece of evidence that we can look towards is the company’s mission statement. During the 1990s, more than half of the U.S. businesses had some kind of mission or vision statement (Levering, 2000; Walter, 1995). This number doubled from 10 years earlier (Levering, 2000). One of the reasons for their recent popularity is that these “statements” try to capture the inherent nature of the company (Verma, 2009). Further, a value statement can act as an ultimate control system; as long as the val-ues are agreed upon, there is need for control \n\n64 Organization Development Journal \n\nDr. Michelle Brodke joined the Bowling Green State University faculty in 2008 as an assistant professor in the department of applied sciences at Firelands College.

(Verma, 2009). These statements are found on the wall in the con-ference room. We have all seen them. “Our com-pany strives to be the best...” They show up as glossy wall posters, table tents, and even laminat-ed wallet cards. They are typically used by organizations to describe why the entity exists, what it is striving to accomplish, what it stands for, and how it plans to achieve its objectives. These statements have become an integral compo-nent of corporate strategy. Statements of this type have become common and expected fixtures with-in every type of organization regardless of indus-try, size, or for-profit status. The creation, publi-cation, and distribution of these statements is one of the most common business practices today. Yet, little empirical research has been done on the subject of corporate mission statements and the like. The most basic of all unresolved issues on this topic is what to call the statements of this genre in general. Two primary purposes that mission statements serve (Klemm et al., 1991) are external and internal communication and motivation (Verma, 2009). They are typically strategic in nature, so they could be called “strategy” state-ments. Yet, they are often descriptive of an orga-nization’s identity, so they could be called “identi-ty” statements. They often describe why an organization exists and what it is seeking to accomplish; thus, they could be called “impera-tive” statements, “purpose” statements or just plain “mission” or “vision” statements. Although lacking a creative flair, “Formalized Organizational Statements” seems to allow for the generality needed when referring to the entire genre of statements typically carrying the label of mission, vision, values, purpose, and principles. CEO David Fagiano indicated that “organizations are living organisms, in many ways very similar to individuals. People have personalities; organi-zations have cultures. Personalities and cultures are formed by values because, quite simply, val-ues state what is important to individuals or busi-nesses” (Fagiano, 1995, p. 5). Strong formalized organizational statements can provide landmarks along the way. Just as a buoy marks a shipping lane and keeps a ship heading in the chosen direc-tion, formalized organizational statements pro-vide the benchmarks to keep an organization, work groups, and individuals on the right path. Personal experience has taught us that individuals in organizations can get so caught up in the race that they forget why they are running. Sooner or later a crisis jars the organization into a painful awareness that they are seriously off course. Therefore, if organizations want to maximize pro-ductivity and ensure that they are doing the “right” work, they must provide organizational members with a clear understanding of who they are, where they are going, and how they are going to get there (see Falsey, 1989). In order to assist organizational leaders in crafting stronger statements, an empirical analysis of the concepts contained within formalized organiza-tional statements must be done. For the purpose of this study, the term “concept” refers to any ele-ment, idea, expression, unique thought, or descriptive language communicated either explic-itly or implicitly within a formalized organiza-tional statement. To date, little empirical work has been done that clearly identifies the unique concepts typically included in formalized organi-zational statements and their frequency of use. The questions that should be answered empirical-ly include: Which concepts are being expressed     \n\n> 65 Volume 29 \u0003Number 1 \u0003Spring 2011\n\nmost typically in these statements? Are there common concepts that seem to be “fashionable” or “trendy?” Understanding these concepts will provide practical insights to future statement writers, allowing them to both avoid cliché and include key concepts. The goal of this study is to conduct a detailed classical content analysis using a large number of formalized organizational statements from a het-erogeneous group of organizations throughout the United States. This content analysis will pro-duce an exhaustive list of the most commonly used elements and provide valuable insight regarding the inclinations of organizations in this regard. In addition, this study seeks to raise awareness of the issues facing practitioners and executives as they consider the creation of a formalized organi-zational statement. It is clear that there is an obvious lack of consistency and standards related to the labeling of these statements. Perhaps it is time to create some universal norms that can be used to communicate and educate organizations and students regarding this key piece of strategic planning and implementation. Maybe then employees can begin to respond to Jim Collins’ call to “ spend the vast majority of your time creating alignment ” (Collins, 2009). \n\nLiterature Review \n\nAlthough the use of formalized organizational statements has been widespread in the United States for several years, there has not been a sig-nificant amount of research done that addresses the content of these formalized statements, or the most common frameworks employed in their con-struction. In fact, there is a void in the literature regarding what these statements actually entail. For example, an Internet database search, of most key business and industry journals, yielded only a handful of related articles that were empirical or theoretical in nature. There are a certain number of studies that include mission statements from a sample of companies, yet with little or no analysis attached (Abrahams, 1995; 2004; Graham & Havlick, 1994; Jones & Kahaner, 1995; Williams, 2008). Most articles are anecdotal in nature. Of the scholarly articles, very few evaluated the content and structure of formalized organizational state-ments (see David & David, 2003; Williams, 2008). \n\nStudies Looking at Structure and Meaning \n\nOne recent study (Williams, 2008) did look at the content of the mission statements. It analyzed the statements gathered from firms listed on the 2006 Fortune 1000 list. After conducting a content analysis of these firms’ mission statements, it was found that the higher-performing firms included eight of the nine recommended components more often than did the lower-performing firms, and the differences were significant for three of those components (Williams, 2008). The results of the study stressed the continuing importance of mis-sion statements. Further, it showed that the con-tent components have not changed significantly in the past 20 years (Williams, 2008). Yet, the study also noted that the authors of mission state-ments usually provided rationales for the compo-nents and labels that they used. Not surprisingly, the resulting variations in terminology and defini-tions limited the comparability of some studies with others. Any long-term benefits were mini-mized. Therefore, although this serious flaw in the mission statement literature had been identi-fied before (e.g., Bart et al., 2001; Peyrefitte & David, 2006; Williams, 2008), it has not yet been fixed.  \n\n> 66 Organization Development Journal\n\nIn another study (Firmin & Gilson, 2010), the mis-sion statements of 107 member institutions of the Coalition of Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) were analyzed. The analysis looked at the frequency of words used in the statements as well as the general constructs expressed. The results in the article were discussed in light of higher education's overall objectives and how mission statements set the tone for institutional setting (Firmin & Gilson, 2010). Yet this content analysis looked at the statements’ role in provid-ing religious training and other aspects of the uni-versity’s function. Another study, focusing on CEOs, dealt with the structure and meaning of organizational vision in the macro sense of the word (Larwood, 1995). This study revealed that a vision statement might be a result of having vision or a vehicle for communicating the vision. However, the study did not examine the content of the statements themselves. Another major study involving vision looked at the effect of a salient vision on strategic involvement and man-agers’ perceptions (Oswald, Mossholder, & Harris, 1997). Although there were numerous articles touting the need for formalized pronouncements of cor-porate identity, mission, or values, as well as arti-cles describing how to write and communicate such statements (for example, see Wall, Sobol, & Solum, 1992; Scott, Jaffee, & Tobe, 1993), few seemed to carefully analyze the content and struc-ture of these central pieces of organizational phi-losophy. Interestingly, one study found that 82% of organizations surveyed had mission state-ments, yet only 40% of those statements appeared to organization members to reflect reality (Wright, 2002). The pervasiveness of use suggests a need to conduct research regarding content and struc-ture of these statements, to ultimately determine if these statements achieve their intended pur-pose. \n\nStudies Looking at the Relationship with Company Performance \n\nLittle research has been done on the relationship between mission statements and company per-formance, and one study that did find mixed results (Bart & Baetz, 1998). Yet, no one seems to doubt the value of formalized organizational statements. One interesting article, published in The Economist, involving multinational managers (Only, 1995), proposed that the globalization underway in many industries today has forced managers into a new paradigm characterized by new players and partnerships. This article explains that “it is far more effective to get people to believe in the company’s values, than to keep issuing them with instructions and keeping a close eye on their performance” (Only, 1995, p. 18). \n\nTwo Other Studies \n\nAnother recent study (Davis et al., 2007) wanted to understand the influence of a mission state-ment’s ethical contents on university students. It found that those universities with ethical state-ments in their mission produced a significantly higher number of students with perceived charac-ter trait importance in comparison to the universi-ties that did not contain these statements. Yet, it was found further that the mission by itself did not produce any orientation unless coupled with the overall strategic education process (Krohe, 1995). In another recent study (Verma, 2009), undertaken to understand the perception and influence of mission statements on executive behavior, found that the mission’s message did not get across to the intended target audience. Another study (Palmer & Short, 2008) analyzed     \n\n> 67 Volume 29 \u0003Number 1 \u0003Spring 2011\n\nthe content of mission statements from 408 AACSB schools. The relationship between mis-sion content and measures of business school characteristics, including performance, was exam-ined. Overall, considerable variance in the content of organizational missions existed. One final study (Desmidt & Prinzie, 2008) examined the data from four Flemish nonprofit healthcare organizations. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all 4,443 organizational mem-bers of the participating organizations. One of the main findings of this study was that organization-al members rarely engage in the behaviors associ-ated with the management of mission statement meaning (Desmidt & Prinzie, 2008). According to William J. Morin (1995), Chairman of Drake Beam, Morin Inc., our society, in general, is in the midst of a “value crisis” (Morin, 1995, p. 10). He observes that we “are becoming a people without rudders, without vision and with values that have very little value at all” (Morin, 1995, p. 10). This situation has resulted in a concept he calls “Silent Sabotage” which he defines as “a turned-off, disenfranchised society that gives up in silent disapproval; it's a worker who comes in later and goes home earlier than he or she did 10 years ago; it's people at work who just don't care” (Morin, 1995, p. 10). To counteract this effect in organizations, leaders must cultivate and align a common set of values and a clear vision (Collins, 2009). After conducting exhaustive research into the essence of companies that have achieved the label of “visionary,” Collins and Porras (1997) conclud-ed that a fundamental element found in all these companies is the presence of a core ideology. The authors describe this as “core values and sense of purpose beyond just making money – that guides and inspires people throughout the organization and remains relatively fixed for long periods of time” (Collins et al., 1997, p. 48). In fact, highly successful and visionary companies have been more ideologically driven than purely profit-driv-en (Collins et al., 1997, p. 55). In another study, Ledford, senior research scien-tist at the Center for Effective Organizations, University of Southern California, refers to a con-cept called “corporate philosophy” (Ledford, Wendenhof, & Strahley, 1995, p. 4). They use this term to include any expression of a corporation’s philosophy, whether the vehicle is a list of values, a vision statement, a mission statement, credo, purpose or other document. Yet, according to many, the need is deeper than simply producing visionary statements. In the words of former National Semi-Conductor CEO Gil Amelio when discussing his experience turn-ing around that company, “... just publishing a Vision statement and speaking in visionary terms at your communications meetings doesn't auto-matically enroll your people to accept it, believe it, and make it work” (Terdoslavich, 1996, p. 115). For example, another interesting concept gaining popularity is that of “Bi-Focal” vision. This is the rather profound concept that stresses the need for clear vision of the distant future as well as clear vision of the here and now (Harari, 1997, p. 46). Values statements have become extremely popu-lar in the recent past. More than half of the val-ues statements in the United States were created between 1989 and 1995 (Walter, 1995). This num-ber was double of what there were in the eighties (Levering, 2000). In fact, upwards of 80 % of the Fortune 500 com-panies in the United States have something that  \n\n> 68 Organization Development Journal\n\nthey call a “values statement” (Walter, 1995, p. 87). In an interview conducted with Medtronic CEO Bill George, the company’s success was said to be found in “rock-solid, mission-driven values that are nonnegotiable and universal” (McKibben, 1995, p. 20). Many organizations prefer the term “mission statement” when communicating core beliefs or purpose. Most commonly, mission or purpose statements clearly state the foundational reason the organization exists. Gerald B. Johanneson, president of Haworth Inc, says “We feel a mission statement lays it right out there as to the kind of company we are and what our principles are and what our objectives are and how we want to work” (Nelton, 1994, p. 61). Although there is not necessarily a right or wrong way to use labels such as \"Vision\", \"Values\", or \"Mission\", this variation can lead to confusion. Organizations are using each of these tools in many different ways with different tech-niques and with different levels of success. This confusion may cause hesitancy on the part of organizational leaders to undertake the task of guiding their companies using strong formalized organizational statements. In addition, the bar-rage of different formalized statements may dilute the motivational power and short-circuit the state-ment’s effectiveness. Ultimately, the impact of such statements may be diminished if they are not constructed carefully and sensibly. No wonder, in yet one last study (Panda & Gupta, 2003), little emotional commitment was found with the mis-sion statement, regardless of the longer term implications for the survival of the company. \n\nMethod \n\nData \n\nThe data analyzed in this study were collected originally via direct mail by an author assembling a book to contain the “mission statements” of approximately 300 American corporations. The sample thus provided a good cross-section of het-erogeneous companies from dozens of industries. The statements were originally gathered and com-piled by author Jeffrey Abrahams for his book entitled “The Mission Statement Book”. Abrahams (1995; 1999) explains in his book that he wrote to 2,600 companies requesting copies of their mission statements. Because little to no qualitative analysis has been conducted on mis-sion statements, we chose to look at this data at a starting point for analysis. We will discuss in the implications section next steps for future research related to comparing content over time. The sources of that list of companies included the \n\nFortune 2000, the Forbes 200, the Inc. 500, and The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America . He also indicated that 875 responded to his inquiry, and that 374 actually acknowledged that they had some sort of mission statement. The data included in the sample consisted of the actual formalized organizational statements from the 300 organizations. These included organiza-tions from a multitude of industries and varied in terms of size and scope. Many of the companies in the sample included more than one distinct statement. Several included separately titled statements within one larger statement context. The total number of distinct statements in the sample was 489. This included 15 statements that were left untitled by the organization.     \n\n> 69 Volume 29 \u0003Number 1 \u0003Spring 2011\n\nIt is not known whether those companies responding to the request for statements actually included all of their formalized organizational strategy statements or only their “mission state-ment.” The actual letter used in the collection of the statements requested the company’s “mission” statement. Therefore, it is safe to assume that a significant number of the companies included in the sample have additional statements worthy of analysis. Similarly, it is important to note that a company’s response indicating that they did not have a “mis-sion statement” does not necessarily mean that they have no formalized organizational state-ments. The responder may have considered the request specific to those statements entitled “mis-sion.” Other responders clearly interpreted the request as any formalized statement that is “mis-sion-like.” Therefore, Abrahams’ (1995; 2004) high-level statistics showing that only 43% of responders actually had mission statements, should not be construed as the percentage of com-panies that truly employ formalized organization-al statements in general. For the purpose of the current study, the variety included in Abraham’s sample was the primary attractive characteristic. The sample provides a good heterogeneous data population from which to do a content analysis. \n\nAnalysis \n\nSince the premise of this paper is exploratory in nature, classical content analysis was employed, using a complex text analysis methodology. Although each individual occurrence of a con-cept’s descriptive word was not coded, if the con-cept emerged in separate sections of a statement or in a slightly different context, it was coded again. In other words, if the word “quality” was used several times in the same sentence, it was not coded unless it represented or described a unique circumstance. For example, the following statement would be coded as including two occurrences of the concept of “Quality-General/TQM”: “We strive to give employees a \n\nquality work environment as we continuously improve our quality as determined by our cus-tomers.” Conversely, the following text would only receive one occurrence of the concept of “Quality-General/TQM: “Everything we do has the highest quality . Quality is important because…” This required painstaking evaluation and eliminated the ability to use a simple text search functionality to identify occurrences of the concepts. \n\n# Results \n\nThe 474 titled statements included in the sample were identified by their companies using 46 dif-ferent names. Fifteen of the statements were left untitled. Table 1 includes the titles and their fre-quency of use within the sample, sorted by fre-quency. After the coding was complete, the total number of separate codes identified and created was 122. Table 2 illustrates the frequency with which the various concepts were found within the data. The frequency of occurrence reflects the number of times the concept was mentioned within the con-text of the sample. In some cases, an individual statement may have contained more than one occurrence of the concept. As identified in the tables, 489 statements were provided by the 300 companies included in the sample, resulting in a ratio of 1.63 statements per      \n\n> 70 Organization Development Journal company. It should be noted that one should not determine from this that companies typically have more than one statement, nor should it be con-strued that companies have an average of 1.63 separate formalized organizational statements.\n> 71 Volume 29 \u0003Number 1 \u0003Spring 2011\n\nFreq.

First, the bulk of the organizations opted to use traditional titles to describe their formalized statements. Second, although there was a significant list of distinct concepts included in the sample, there was a strong consistency between the statements in terms of a few key concepts. Third, evaluation of the statements revealed a phenomenon we refer to as concept “density” in which several unique and highly meaningful concepts are loaded into a very short statement, thus creating a density that can be measured, as described below. The titles used to describe formalized organiza-tional statements range from highly traditional to unique. While some organizations choose to leave their statements untitled, others choose to create their own title by combining one or more traditional titles. It is interesting to note that just 10% of the titles were applied to 78% of the statements. The top five most frequently used titles (Mission, Vision, Values, Principles, and Strategies) resulted in 382 of the 489 total statements. This seems to indicate that the majority of companies choose to use tra-ditional titles versus opting for a more unique and creative approach. Analysis of the statements, however, revealed that the specific concepts within the statements are often communicated uniquely and without using traditional words or phrases. For instance, the concept of Shareholder Return/Value was an over-whelmingly pleonastic concept in the sample. The statement writers described the recipients of that return or value, as shareholders, stockhold- \n\n> 74 Organization Development Journal\n\nFreq. Concept Freq.

These occur-rences were unique but all communicated the same concept. This careful analysis revealed that the concept of “Shareholder Return/Value” was mentioned 255 times. This should be contrasted with the 114 times the word “Shareholders” was used as indicated by Abrahams (1995; 2004). It should also be noted that it was Abrahams’ inten-tion only to illustrate the most common key words and phrases used in the statements. He did not intend his word and phrase counts to be interpreted as inclusive of the concepts being communicated. Hence, this particular study, by applying a complex content analysis, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of concepts com-municated. In many instances, the same concept emerged multiple times within the statements provided by a company. Sometimes, company officials includ-ed the same concept in all of their separate state-ments. In addition, there were multiple examples of companies using a particular concept several times within the same statement. While carefully reviewing the data, we were often amazed by the number of distinct concepts com-municated within a statement or even within a sentence. We use the term “density” to describe this phenomenon. A quick tabulation of the results shows the total number of concept occur-rences to be 5,673. This means that on average; nearly 12 different concepts were discussed per statement and 18 different concepts per company. There were many, many instances of organiza-tions packing up to 20 strategic and descriptive words and concepts into a very short statement. \n\nLimitations and Further Research \n\nAlthough this research provides good empirical data with which to understand the concepts that companies are communicating with their formal-ized organizational statements, there is significant room for additional study. Future qualitative analysis projects should focus on understanding the actual proliferation of formalized organiza-tional statements within organizations. This study does not attempt to answer the question of how many companies have formally written state-ments. Neither does it contemplate the number of different statements a company writes over time. Rather, our focus was on examining the conceptu-al framework inherent in mission statements. Since the data are over 10 years old, we ask: What is different today? As mentioned, we see this study as a starting point for a conceptual frame-work. From here, future research can look at how the core concepts identified here have changed over time. In addition, future research could investigate rela-tionships between various concepts within the context of a statement. This would allow for the gathering of additional insights into what things are being communicated within each uniquely titled statement. Understanding what is currently being communicated as vision, purpose, mission, or values would be the first step in developing a framework that could lead to consistent societal definitions of the mission, vision, purpose, or val-ues statement. Although we are not convinced that there is sig-nificance in what a company chooses to call their statement, developing norms around formalized organizational statements would enhance the abil-ity to communicate about them in corporate and     \n\n> 75 Volume 29 \u0003Number 1 \u0003Spring 2011\n\neducational settings. In addition, a universal framework could assist organizations in the development of these statements and create a sense of familiarity. The blank sheet being used today would be replaced with a general frame-work within which to work. Finally, there seems to be a need for additional research into the concept of density within state-ments. For instance, is there a correlation between the density of a statement and the level of ownership within the organization? Is there a correlation between density and organization per-formance? As for practical implications, executives will acknowledge that there is a widespread skepti-cism within many organizations today regarding the corporate mission statement. Fueled by popu-lar comic strips that provide a satirical look at the things organizations say and do, employees are becoming cynically aware of overused, under-practiced corporate rhetoric. \n\n# Conclusions \n\nThere were clear instances that the impact of the statement seemed to be diminished and diluted by all the corporate buzzwords and politically correct terminology (see also Lewis, 1999). A pop-ular approach was to attempt to communicate multiple messages or feelings by strategically employing key words and phrases. In those cases, there was no attempt to clarify, explain, or operationalize the concepts. In our opinion, this phenomenon gives the appearance that the com-pany felt a concept was important enough to include in their formalized organizational state-ment, but not important enough to explain what it meant or how it would be applied practically. Another interesting result of the study related to the recurrence of various concepts across state-ments and organizations. It was clear that a small number of concepts are consistently included in formalized organizational statements. There is a “short list” of issues that companies feel must or should be communicated within their personal, formalized statements. This is probably, in large measure, indicative of the fact that most compa-nies have similar needs, motives, objectives and concerns. For-profit companies exist in an envi-ronment that is built upon providing a specific product or service to a customer while meeting certain financial expectations as prescribed by the owners or investors of the organization. Because of that, it should be expected that their formalized organizational statements of mission, vision, or values center on issues dealing with quality, serv-ice, customers, and shareholders. We believe it is important for leaders and strategic planning consultants to acknowledge this danger and work to ensure that the concepts being expressed in formalized organizational statements are reflective of the organization’s true identity. Employees and customers are more sophisticated now, and are easily seeing through the trendy business buzzwords being used. We hope that this research sets the stage for future conversation and more exploration into the meaning and use of mission statements as a viable mechanism for an organization’s identity and culture. \n\n# References \n\nAbrahams, J.
