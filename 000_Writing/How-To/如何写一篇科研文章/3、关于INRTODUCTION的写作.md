新能源发展 和 火电
煤电
煤炭消费

1.煤电不能代表煤炭消费。煤电应该是煤炭消费的主体
2.火电不是煤电。煤电是火电的主体。
3.我们做了新能源对火电的实证分析。
然而，我是倾向于做成 新能源发展如何影响煤炭消费的。

introduction 
Increasing  efficiency is considered an economical and effective option in terms of climate change mitigation strategies. Increased energy efficiency also provides additional benefits. It can reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution, promote sustainable social and economic development, and promote the decoupling of economic development and energy consumption [1]. Because of the advancement of digital technology, digitalization has attracted significant attention on a global scale and is one of the key componentsof the transitionto a new energy system [2,3]. Digital technology makes energy systems more flexible and efficient. The application of digital technologies in energy efficiency has great potential [4,5]. The data collection and analysis capabilities of digital technology make devices smarter. The connectivity of digital technology enables systems with intelligent automation equipment to be more energy efficient. Energy management systems based on digital technologies provide a powerful tool for saving energy in homes and buildings [6]. Smart cities can lower energy use in infrastructure and public transportation by utilizing digital technologies [7]. Since digitalization encourages the optimization of industrial structure, technical innovation, and boosts production efficiency, it is effective for energy conservation and efficiency improvement [8–10]. However, several studies hold differing views. They believe that energy demand will increase owing to digital technology. The quantity of data centers, data transmission networks, and terminal electronic equipment is expanding quickly due to the speedy advancement of digital technology. The operation of services comes at a cost to energy due to the energy-intensive infrastructure required to sustain digital connectivity [11]. More comfortabledigital services lead to more energy demand [12]. Utilizing digital technology could also cause a rebound effect and result in higher energy consumption [13]. The application of digital technology could result in a spike in energyintensity, particularly in the service and technology-intensive sectors [14]. The relationship between digitalization and energy efficiency is complex and controversial. Some studies even state that it is challenging to conclude because of the variety of digital implications on energy use [15,16]. Understanding the connection between digitalization and energy efficiency may help countries who want to emphasize both in their policy reach their goals more efficiently and economically. This article builds a digitalization evaluation index system and determines the digitalization level of 90 nations from 2000 to 2020 to assess the causal relationship between digitalization and energy efficiency. Then a two-way fixed effect model is constructed, as a quadratic term of the core explanatory variable is added to the model to explore the nonlinear relationship. Subsequently, the two-stage least square method and generalized method of moments model were used to eliminate endogenous interference, while a series of robustness tests were carried out. Finally, the heterogeneity is discussed from three aspects: national nature, energy endowment, and electrification level. These are the potential contributions of this study. First, the digital level of 90 economies from 2000 to 2020 was measured. Infrastructure, digital and application, and digital skills make up the system’s three components for evaluating the digital level. The measurement results account for both developed and developing economies as well as the trend in digital technology development. It provides statistical backing for the research of digital subjects. Second, it explores the nonlinear relationship and heterogeneous effect of digitalization on energy efficiency. Different from the existing studies [8,9,13], which only focus on linear effects and the same group, this paper explores the nonlinear effects of digitalization on energy efficiency based on the development characteristics of digital technology. This research also explores the diverse impacts of digitalization on energy efficiency in various countries, offering new empirical proof for digital development and energy efficiency improvement. Third, this paper gathers transnational panel data from developed and developing countries for research and puts forward targeted policy recommendations based on the empirical results. It can serve as a guide for countries at different stages of development when drafting pertinent policies. Five sections make up the remaining text of the article. Section 2 summarizes the current research situation, and the theoretical analysis of the nonlinear relationship is carried out. Section 3 is where the research model is built. The data sources are described in Section 4. The results are presented and discussed in Section 5. The final section outlines the research findings, along with suggestions for policy and further research.
